Dodoor leverages advanced\nresearch on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike\nother decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote\nservers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information,\nwhich is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule\ntasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous\ncluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each\nscheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks\nin contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance\nload. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two\nworkloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real\nserverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that\nDodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can\nalso increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency\nby 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two\nworkloads."}

OpenDerisk is open source and available at\nhttps://github.com/derisk-ai/OpenDerisk/"}

Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000\ncommits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an\nindustrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their\noutcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI\nsystems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline\ndataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed\nreasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the\nmajority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours\ntypically required for manual debugging."}

Cherian"], "title": "Property Testing for Ocean Models. Can We Specify It? (Invited Talk)", "comment": "In Proceedings VSS 2025, arXiv:2510.12314", "summary": "I take inspiration from the property-testing literature, particularly the\nwork of Prof. John Hughes, and explore how such ideas might be applied to\nnumerical models of the ocean. Specifically, I ask whether geophysical fluid\ndynamics (GFD) theory, expressed as property tests, might be used to address\nthe oracle problem of testing the correctness of ocean models. I propose that a\nnumber of simple idealized GFD problems can be framed as property tests. These\nexamples clearly illustrate how physics naturally lends itself to specifying\nproperty tests. Which of these proposed tests might be most feasible and\nuseful, remains to be seen."}

This enhances their ability to\ngenerate accurate and context-aware code completions. In this work, we\ninvestigate how different repository-processing strategies affect in-context\nlearning in OpenCoder, a 1.5B-parameter model. We extend its context window\nfrom 4,096 to 16,384 tokens by training on additional 1B tokens of curated\nrepository-level data. Despite relying on a smaller dataset than competing\nmodels (which often use hundreds of billions of tokens), our model achieves\ncomparable performance on the Long Code Arena benchmark. We find that various\nrepository-processing techniques yield similarly strong results, with the\nprimary gain coming from adapting to a new rotary positional embedding (RoPE)\nscaling parameter. Finally, we show that a simpler file-level training approach\nat the original sequence length remains highly effective, opening up\nrepository-level code completion research to settings with more constrained\ndata and compute resources."}

This cluster-agnostic API allows requests to be distributed\nacross federated clusters, targeting numerous hosted models. FIRST supports\nmultiple inference backends (e.g., vLLM), auto-scales resources, maintains\n\"hot\" nodes for low-latency execution, and offers both high-throughput batch\nand interactive modes. The framework addresses the growing demand for private,\nsecure, and scalable AI inference in scientific workflows, allowing researchers\nto generate billions of tokens daily on-premises without relying on commercial\ncloud infrastructure."}
