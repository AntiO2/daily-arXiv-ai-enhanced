The CCMS produces a set of counts that describe how the clusters produced by the first process are transformed by the second process based on four possible transformation scenarios. The transformations are that a cluster formed in the first process either remains unchanged, merges into a larger cluster, is partitioned into smaller clusters, or otherwise overlaps with multiple clusters formed in the second process. The CCMS produces a count for each of these cases, accounting for every cluster formed in the first process. In addition, when run in analysis mode, the CCMS program can assist the user in evaluating these changes by displaying the details for all changes or only for certain types of changes. The paper includes a detailed description of the CCMS process and program and examples of how the CCMS has been applied in university and industry research."}

Recent state-of-the-art solutions leverage large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality answers. However, most rely on proprietary, large-scale LLMs with costly API access, posing a significant financial barrier. This paper instead focuses on TQA with smaller, open-weight LLMs that can run on a desktop or laptop. This setting is challenging, as such LLMs typically have weaker capabilities than large proprietary models, leading to substantial performance degradation with existing methods.\n  We observe that a key reason for this degradation is that prior approaches often require the LLM to solve a highly sophisticated task using long, complex prompts, which exceed the capabilities of small open-weight LLMs. Motivated by this observation, we present Orchestra, a multi-agent approach that unlocks the potential of accessible LLMs for high-quality, cost-effective TQA. Orchestra coordinates a group of LLM agents, each responsible for a relatively simple task, through a structured, layered workflow to solve complex TQA problems -- akin to an orchestra. By reducing the prompt complexity faced by each agent, Orchestra significantly improves output reliability.\n  We implement Orchestra on top of AgentScope, an open-source multi-agent framework, and evaluate it on multiple TQA benchmarks using a wide range of open-weight LLMs. Experimental results show that Orchestra achieves strong performance even with small- to medium-sized models. For example, with Qwen2.5-14B, Orchestra reaches 72.1% accuracy on WikiTQ, approaching the best prior result of 75.3% achieved with GPT-4; with larger Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek models, Orchestra outperforms all prior methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks."}

We propose SpANNS, a near-memory processing architecture for sparse ANNS. SpANNS combines a hybrid inverted index with efficient query management and runtime optimizations. The architecture is built on a CXL Type-2 near-memory platform, where a specialized controller manages query parsing and cluster filtering, while compute-enabled DIMMs perform index traversal and distance computations close to the data.

Through controlled comparisons, VCP aims to provide a quantitative basis for educators to determine the optimal pedagogical boundary: identifying contexts where Vibe Coding fosters genuine mastery and contexts where it introduces hidden technical debt and superficial competence."}

To address these challenges, we introduce WebCoderBench, the first real-world-collected, generalizable, and interpretable benchmark for web app generation. WebCoderBench comprises 1,572 real user requirements, covering diverse modalities and expression styles that reflect realistic user intentions. WebCoderBench provides 24 fine-grained evaluation metrics across 9 perspectives, combining rule-based and LLM-as-a-judge paradigm for fully automated, objective, and general evaluation. Moreover, WebCoderBench adopts human-preference-aligned weights over metrics to yield interpretable overall scores.

Existing multimodal approaches typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations from pretrained language models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations from graph neural networks, often under the implicit assumption that adding a modality necessarily yields extra information. In practice, sequence and graph representations can be redundant, and fluctuations in the quality of the graph modality can dilute the discriminative signal of the dominant modality. To address this, we propose TaCCS-DFA, a framework that introduces Fisher information as a geometric measure of how sensitive feature directions are to the classification decision, enabling task-oriented complementary fusion. TaCCS-DFA online estimates a low-rank principal Fisher subspace and restricts cross-modal attention to task-sensitive directions, thereby retrieving structural features from CPG that complement the sequence modality; meanwhile, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of the graph modality for each sample to suppress noise propagation. Our analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, the proposed mechanism admits a tighter risk bound than conventional full-spectrum attention. Experiments on BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal show that TaCCS-DFA achieves strong performance across multiple backbones. With CodeT5 as the backbone, TaCCS-DFA reaches an F1 score of 87.80\\% on the highly imbalanced BigVul dataset, improving over a strong baseline Vul-LMGNNs by 6.3 percentage points while maintaining low calibration error and computational overhead."}

By using sandboxed execution, detailed failure reporting, and iterative regeneration or patching of failing tests, the framework autonomously improves test quality and expands coverage.

While several techniques have been proposed to address this, limited empirical evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of applying them to LLM-based industry applications. To fill this gap, we analyzed a chatbot application in an industrial context at Schuberg Philis, a Dutch IT services company. We then selected four techniques, namely Small and Large Model Collaboration, Prompt Optimization, Quantization, and Batching, applied them to the application in eight variations, and then conducted experiments to study their impact on energy consumption, accuracy, and response time compared to the unoptimized baseline.\n  Our results show that several techniques, such as Prompt Optimization and 2-bit Quantization, managed to reduce energy use significantly, sometimes by up to 90%. However, these techniques especially impacted accuracy negatively, to a degree that is not acceptable in practice. The only technique that achieved significant and strong energy reductions without harming the other qualities substantially was Small and Large Model Collaboration via Nvidia's Prompt Task and Complexity Classifier (NPCC) with prompt complexity thresholds. This highlights that reducing the energy consumption of LLM-based applications is not difficult in practice. However, improving their energy efficiency, i.e., reducing energy use without harming other qualities, remains challenging. Our study provides practical insights to move towards this goal."}

Notably, finding an optimal retrieval threshold and reducing embedding size substantially reduced energy consumption and latency with no loss in accuracy, making these two techniques truly energy-efficient.

However, traces from OS kernels or large-scale applications like Chrome or MySQL are massive and difficult to analyze.

This paper introduces TAAF (Trace Abstraction and Analysis Framework), a novel approach that combines time-indexing, knowledge graphs (KGs), and large language models (LLMs) to transform raw trace data into actionable insights. TAAF constructs a time-indexed KG from trace events to capture relationships among entities such as threads, CPUs, and system resources. An LLM then interprets query-specific subgraphs to answer natural-language questions, reducing the need for manual inspection and deep system expertise. To evaluate TAAF, we introduce TraceQA-100, a benchmark of 100 questions grounded in real kernel traces. Experiments across three LLMs and multiple temporal settings show that TAAF improves answer accuracy by up to 31.2%, particularly in multi-hop and causal reasoning tasks. We further analyze where graph-grounded reasoning helps and where limitations remain, offering a foundation for next-generation trace analysis tools."}

Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While many traditional graph-based and deep learning approaches have been explored for this task, they often rely heavily on pre-defined schemas that struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts. Consequently, a number of LLM-based methods have recently been proposed. However, these methods still face two major limitations: shallow, symptom-centric reasoning that undermines accuracy, and a lack of cross-alert reuse that leads to redundant reasoning and high latency. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) localize the root causes of failures, drawing insights from professionals across multiple organizations. Our investigation reveals that expert root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce AMER-RCL, an agentic memory enhanced recursive reasoning framework for root cause localization in microservices. AMER-RCL employs the Recursive Reasoning RCL engine, a multi-agent framework that performs recursive reasoning on each alert to progressively refine candidate causes, while Agentic Memory incrementally accumulates and reuses reasoning from prior alerts within a time window to reduce redundant exploration and lower inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that AMER-RCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and inference efficiency."}

Yet, the intrinsic complexity and dynamic runtime interactions of such systems inevitably give rise to anomalies. Ensuring system reliability therefore hinges on effective root cause analysis (RCA), which entails not only localizing the source of anomalies but also characterizing the underlying failures in a timely and interpretable manner. Recent advances in intelligent RCA techniques, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated promising capabilities, as LLMs reduce reliance on handcrafted features while offering cross-platform adaptability, task generalization, and flexibility. However, existing LLM-based methods still suffer from two critical limitations: (a) limited exploration diversity, which undermines accuracy, and (b) heavy dependence on large-scale LLMs, which results in slow inference. To overcome these challenges, we propose SpecRCA, a speculative root cause analysis framework for microservices that adopts a \\textit{hypothesize-then-verify} paradigm. SpecRCA first leverages a hypothesis drafting module to rapidly generate candidate root causes, and then employs a parallel root cause verifier to efficiently validate them. Preliminary experiments on the AIOps 2022 dataset demonstrate that SpecRCA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for scalable and interpretable RCA in complex microservice environments."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose CodeMEM, an AST-guided dynamic memory management system tailored for repository-level iterative code generation. Specifically, CodeMEM introduces the Code Context Memory component that dynamically maintains and updates repository context through AST-guided LLM operations, along with the Code Session Memory that constructs a code-centric representation of interaction history and explicitly detects and mitigates forgetting through AST-based analysis. Experimental results on the instruction-following benchmark CodeIF-Bench and the code generation benchmark CoderEval demonstrate that CodeMEM achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving instruction following by 12.2% for the current turn and 11.5% for the session level, and reducing interaction rounds by 2-3, while maintaining competitive inference latency and token efficiency."}

Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques for classifying bug reports to identify security bug reports rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data. However, datasets for security bug reports are often scarce in practice, leading to poor model performance and limited applicability in real-world settings. In this study, we propose a few-shot learning-based technique to effectively identify security bug reports using limited labeled data. We employ SetFit, a state-of-the-art few-shot learning framework that combines sentence transformers with contrastive learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The model is trained on a small labeled dataset of bug reports and is evaluated on its ability to classify these reports as either security-related or non-security-related. Our approach achieves an AUC of 0.865, at best, outperforming traditional ML techniques (baselines) for all of the evaluated datasets. This highlights the potential of SetFit to effectively identify security bug reports. SetFit-based few-shot learning offers a promising alternative to traditional ML techniques to identify security bug reports. The approach enables efficient model development with minimal annotation effort, making it highly suitable for scenarios where labeled data is scarce."}

While much research has focused on high-rated applications, low-rated applications often remain unexplored, despite their potential to reveal valuable insights. This study introduces a novel dataset curated from 64 low-rated applications sourced from the Amazon Software Appstore (ASA), containing 79,821 user reviews. The dataset is designed to capture the most frequent issues identified by users, which are critical for improving software quality. To further enhance the dataset utility, a subset of 6000 reviews was manually annotated to classify them into six district issue categories: user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), functionality and features, compatibility and device specificity, performance and stability, customer support and responsiveness, and security and privacy issues. This annotated dataset is a valuable resource for developing machine learning-based approaches aiming to automate the classification of user feedback into various issue types. Making both the annotated and raw datasets publicly available provides researchers and developers with a crucial tool to understand common issues in low-rated apps and inform software improvements. The comprehensive analysis and availability of this dataset lay the groundwork for data-derived solutions to improve software quality based on user feedback. Additionally, the dataset can provide opportunities for software vendors and researchers to explore various software evolution-related activities, including frequently missing features, sarcasm, and associated emotions, which will help better understand the reasons for comparatively low app ratings."}

Existing technologies primarily focus on path optimization in 360-degree image datasets and 3D simulators, which cannot be directly applied to immersive VR environments. To address this gap, we present NavAI, a generalizable large language model (LLM)-based navigation framework that supports both basic actions and complex goal-directed tasks across diverse VR applications. We evaluate NavAI in three distinct VR environments through goal-oriented and exploratory tasks. Results show that it achieves high accuracy, with an 89% success rate in goal-oriented tasks. Our analysis also highlights current limitations of relying entirely on LLMs, particularly in scenarios that require dynamic goal assessment. Finally, we discuss the limitations observed during the experiments and offer insights for future research directions."}
