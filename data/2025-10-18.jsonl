ScalePool integrates\nAccelerator-Centric Links (XLink) and Compute Express Link (CXL) into a unified\nXLink-CXL hybrid fabric. Specifically, ScalePool employs XLink for\nintra-cluster, low-latency accelerator communication, while using hierarchical\nCXL-based switching fabrics for scalable and coherent inter-cluster memory\nsharing. By abstracting interfaces through CXL, ScalePool structurally resolves\ninteroperability constraints, enabling heterogeneous cluster operation and\ncomposable resource disaggregation. In addition, ScalePool introduces explicit\nmemory tiering: the latency-critical tier-1 combines accelerator-local memory\nwith coherence-centric CXL and XLink, whereas the highcapacity tier-2 employs\ndedicated memory nodes interconnected by a CXL-based fabric, achieving scalable\nand efficient memory pooling. Evaluation results show that ScalePool\naccelerates LLM training by 1.22x on average and up to 1.84x compared to\nconventional RDMA-based environments. Furthermore, the proposed tier-2 memory\ndisaggregation strategy reduces latency by up to 4.5x for memory-intensive\nworkloads."}
