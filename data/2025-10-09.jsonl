When this throughput need exceeds the\ncapacity of the machine hosting the structure, one either needs to replace the\nunderlying hardware (an option that is typically not viable and introduces a\nlong down time) or make the data structure distributed. Static partitioning of\nthe data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven\nload distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later\nwill require downtime.\n  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication\nsupport from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion\nof conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation\nwith reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present\nDiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that\ncan be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists\nand (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines. DiLi\ncontains primitives for these that also maintain the lock-free property of the\nunderlying search structure that supports find, remove, and insert of a key as\nthe client operations.\n  Searching for an item in DiLi is by a novel traversal that involves a binary\nsearch on the partitioning scheme, and then a linear traversal on a limitable\nnumber of linked nodes. As a result, we are able to empirically show that DiLi\nperforms as well as the state-of-the-art lock-free concurrent search structures\nthat are based off of a linked list when executed on a single-machine. We also\nshow that the throughput of DiLi scales linearly with the number of machines\nthat host it."}

A typical example of such a system is a main-memory\ndatabase that provides strong eventual consistency. This problem is important\nand challenging for several reasons: (1) eventual consistency often creates\nanomalies that the users do not anticipate. Hence, frequent checkpoints to\nascertain desired invariants is highly beneficial in their use, and (2)\ntraditional checkpoints lead to significant overhead and/or inconsistencies. By\nshowing that the traditional checkpoint leads to inconsistencies or excessive\noverhead, we define the notion of size-minimal checkpointing for fully\nreplicated databases. We present an algorithm for checkpointing with minimal\ncheckpointing overhead (only O(n) new messages and addition of a single counter\nfor existing messages). It also provides a significant benefit over existing\ncheckpointing algorithms for distributed systems and main-memory databases.\n  A key benefit of DTCS is that it summarizes the computation by a sequence of\nsnapshots that are strongly consistent even though the underlying computation\nis weakly consistent.

In many\nsoftware teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented\nby only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these\nexperts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct\ncybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support\ncybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats\nduring the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of\nleveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented\ngeneration to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain\nwhile complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit\nexternal data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts\nin interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.\nThe results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by\ngenerating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing\nredundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight\nto ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing\nto utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely\nrelying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that\nencourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of\ncyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains."}

A cornerstone\nof these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to\ngenerate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the\nconsistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be\nautomated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper\nexplores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and\ninstantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards\nfully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity,\nthey are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug\nreports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM\ninvocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and\neconomical.\n  To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core\nconcept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing\nplaceholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a\nplaceholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate\npairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This\nequivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure\nsoundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are\ninstantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by\nLLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and\nevaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously\nunknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already\nfixed by the developers."}

Submitted to ICSE SEIP 2026 (Software\n  Engineering in Practice)", "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a burgeoning\necosystem of specialized, domain-specific models. While this rapid growth\naccelerates innovation, it has simultaneously created significant challenges in\nmodel discovery and adoption. Users struggle to navigate this landscape due to\ninconsistent, incomplete, and imbalanced documentation across platforms.\nExisting documentation frameworks, such as Model Cards and FactSheets, attempt\nto standardize reporting but are often static, predominantly qualitative, and\nlack the quantitative mechanisms needed for rigorous cross-model comparison.\nThis gap exacerbates model underutilization and hinders responsible adoption.\nTo address these shortcomings, we introduce the Comprehensive Responsible AI\nModel Card Framework (CRAI-MCF), a novel approach that transitions from static\ndisclosures to actionable, human-aligned documentation. Grounded in Value\nSensitive Design (VSD), CRAI-MCF is built upon an empirical analysis of 240\nopen-source projects, distilling 217 parameters into an eight-module,\nvalue-aligned architecture. Our framework introduces a quantitative sufficiency\ncriterion to operationalize evaluation and enables rigorous cross-model\ncomparison under a unified scheme. By balancing technical, ethical, and\noperational dimensions, CRAI-MCF empowers practitioners to efficiently assess,\nselect, and adopt LLMs with greater confidence and operational integrity."}

This paper presents a detailed\nexperience report on the development of the AI Bill of Materials AIBOM\nspecification, an extension of the ISO/IEC 5962:2021 Software Package Data\nExchange (SPDX) software bill of materials (SBOM) standard, which captures AI\ncomponents such as datasets and iterative training artifacts.

The resulting\nspecification was validated through four complementary approaches: alignment\nwith major regulations and ethical standards (e.g., EU AI Act and IEEE 7000\nstandards), systematic mapping to six industry use cases, semi-structured\npractitioner interviews, and an industrial case study. Beyond delivering a\nvalidated artefact, our paper documents the process of building the AIBOM\nspecification in the wild, and reflects on how it aligns with the AR cycle, and\ndistills lessons that can inform future standardization efforts in the software\nengineering community."}

Current approaches (e.g., SafeCoder) to improve secure code\ngeneration suffer from limited and imbalanced datasets, reducing their\neffectiveness and generalizability. In this work, we present Secure-Instruct, a\nnovel framework that automatically synthesizes high-quality vulnerable and\nsecure code examples, generates fine-tuning instructions, and instruction-tunes\nLLMs to align task description and secure code generation abilities. We\nevaluate Secure-Instruct on four representative LLMs using two benchmarks: our\nown CWEBench and the existing CWEval. CWEBench comprises 93 scenarios on 44\nCWEs, all without overlap with Secure-Instruct's synthetic instruction-tuning\ndataset, while CWEval covers 31 CWEs with 119 manually verified\nsecurity-critical tasks. We find that Secure-Instruct improves not only the\nsecurity but also the functional correctness of the generated code. On\nCWEBench, Secure-Instruct substantially improves secure code generation, giving\na 14.3% average increase in secure ratio over the pretrained models and\noutperforms SafeCoder by 7.6%. On CWEval, Secure-Instruct achieves a 14%\nincrease for CodeLlama-7B and 5.8% for Mistral-7B in Func-Sec@1 over pretrained\nmodels, and surpasses SafeCoder by 15.8% and 6.8% respectively."}

Still, classical imperative process models, which are typically\nformalized using Petri nets, are not straightforwardly applicable to the\nrelational databases that contain much of the available structured process\nexecution data. This creates a gap between the traditional world of process\nmodeling and recent developments around data-driven process analysis,\nultimately leading to the under-utilization of often readily available process\nmodels. In this paper, we close this gap by providing an approach for\ntranslating imperative models into relaxed process data queries, specifically\nSQL queries executable on relational databases, for conformance checking. Our\nresults show the continued relevance of imperative process models to\ndata-driven process management, as well as the importance of behavioral\nfootprints and other declarative approaches for integrating model-based and\ndata-driven process management."}

A cornerstone\nof these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to\ngenerate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the\nconsistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be\nautomated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper\nexplores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and\ninstantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards\nfully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity,\nthey are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug\nreports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM\ninvocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and\neconomical.\n  To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core\nconcept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing\nplaceholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a\nplaceholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate\npairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This\nequivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure\nsoundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are\ninstantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by\nLLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and\nevaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously\nunknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already\nfixed by the developers."}
