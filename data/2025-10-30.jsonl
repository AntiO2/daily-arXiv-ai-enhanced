In this work, we\npropose an efficient lossy compression framework that exactly preserves all\ncritical-point trajectories in time-varying vector fields. Our contributions\nare threefold.

MoE models rely on expert\nparallelism (EP) to alleviate memory bottleneck, which introduces all-to-all\ncommunication to dispatch and combine tokens across devices. However, in\nwidely-adopted GPU clusters, high-overhead cross-node communication makes\nall-to-all expensive, hindering the adoption of EP. Recently, wafer-scale chips\n(WSCs) have emerged as a platform integrating numerous devices on a wafer-sized\ninterposer. WSCs provide a unified high-performance network connecting all\ndevices, presenting a promising potential for hosting MoE models.

A Study of Homonymous Gathering in Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "A team of mobile agents, starting from distinct nodes of a network, have to\nmeet at the same node and declare that they all met. Agents execute the same\nalgorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent\nentering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the\nnetwork in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly\nlocal. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed\nmobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity,\ni.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent\nand the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions\ntypically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known\nonly to themselves. But must all labels be pairwise distinct to guarantee\ndeterministic gathering?\n  We address this question by considering agents that may share the same label.\nA team L is said to be gatherable if, for every initial setting of L, there is\nan algorithm that solves gathering. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give\na full characterization of the gatherable teams. (2) We design an algorithm\nthat gathers all of them in poly$(n,\\log\\lambda)$ time, where $n$ (resp.\n$\\lambda$) is the graph order (resp. the smallest label in L). This algorithm\nrequires the agents to initially share only $O(\\log \\log \\log \\mu)$ bits of\ncommon knowledge, where $\\mu$ is the largest label multiplicity in L. (3) We\nshow this dependency is almost optimal to get a poly$(n,\\log\\lambda)$-time\ncomplexity.\n  As a by-product, we get the first deterministic poly$(n,\\log\\lambda)$-time\nalgorithm requiring no common knowledge to gather any team when all labels are\ndistinct. Known to be achievable for two-agent teams, extending this to any\nteam size faced a major challenge: termination detection. Our techniques to\naddress it may be of independent interest."}

However, generic summaries\nalone are insufficient to meet the diverse needs of practitioners; for example,\ndevelopers expect the implementation insights to be presented in an untangled\nmanner, while users seek clear usage instructions. This highlights the\nnecessity of multi-intent comment generation. With the widespread adoption of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, these models have been\nleveraged to tackle the challenge of multi-intent comment generation. Despite\ntheir successes, state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches often struggle to\nconstruct correct relationships among intents, code, and comments within a\nsmaller number of demonstration examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose a\nframework named KUMIC for multi-intent comment generation.

Then,\nKUMIC leverages CoT to guide LLMs to focus on statements facilitating the\nderivation of code comments aligned with specific intents. In this context,\nKUMIC constructs a mapping knowledge chain, linking code to intent-specific\nstatements to comments, which enables LLMs to follow similar reasoning steps\nwhen generating the desired comments. We conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate KUMIC, and the results demonstrate that KUMIC outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by 14.49\\%, 22.41\\%, 20.72\\%, and 12.94\\% in terms\nof BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SBERT, respectively."}

We present Prometheus, a\nnovel AI-assisted system that facilitates automated code verification with\ncurrent AI capabilities in conjunction with modular software engineering\nprinciples (e.g., modular refactoring). Our approach begins by decomposing\ncomplex program logic, such as nested loops, into smaller, verifiable\ncomponents.

Prometheus addresses this by guiding the proof search through\nstructured decomposition of complex lemmas into smaller, verifiable sub-lemmas.\nWhen automated tools are insufficient, users can provide lightweight natural\nlanguage guidance to steer the proof process effectively. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that transiently applying modular restructuring to the code\nsubstantially improves the AI's effectiveness in verifying individual\ncomponents.
