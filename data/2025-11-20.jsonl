Despite recent advances in LLMs for Text2SQL code generation, existing approaches focus primarily on SELECT queries, neglecting the challenges of SQL update operations and their ripple effects. Traditional CASCADE UPDATE constraints are static and unsuitable for modern, denormalized databases, which demand dynamic, context-aware updates. Castle enables natural language instructions to trigger multi-column, causally consistent SQL UPDATE statements, without revealing table content to the model. By framing UPDATE SQL generation as a divide-and-conquer task with LLMs' reasoning capacity, Castle can determine not only which columns must be directly updated, but also how those updates propagate through the schema, causing cascading updates -- all via nested queries and substructures that ensure data confidentiality. We evaluate it on real-world causal update scenarios, demonstrating its ability to produce accurate SQL updates, and thereby highlighting the reasoning ability of LLMs in automated DBMS."}

However, most existing DocVQA datasets are limited to the page level and lack fine grained spatial grounding, constraining the interpretability and reasoning capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this gap, we introduce BBox DocVQA a large scale, bounding box grounded dataset designed to enhance spatial reasoning and evidence localization in visual documents. We further present an automated construction pipeline, Segment Judge and Generate, which integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification for quality assurance. The resulting dataset contains 3.6 K diverse documents and 32 K QA pairs, encompassing single and multi region as well as single and multi page scenarios. Each QA instance is grounded on explicit bounding boxes, enabling fine grained evaluation of spatial semantic alignment. Benchmarking multiple state of the art VLMs (e.g., GPT 5, Qwen2.5 VL, and InternVL) on BBox DocVQA reveals persistent challenges in spatial grounding and reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, fine tuning on BBox DocVQA substantially improves both bounding box localization and answer generation, validating its effectiveness for enhancing the reasoning ability of VLMs. Our dataset and code will be publicly released to advance research on interpretable and spatially grounded vision language reasoning."}

Most current VDBs employ variants of a graph-based ap- proximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) index algorithm, HNSW, to an- swer semantic queries over stored vectors. Inspite of its wide-spread use, the HNSW algorithm suffers from several issues: in-memory design and implementation, random memory accesses leading to degradation in cache behavior, limited acceleration scope due to fine-grained pairwise computations, and support of only semantic similarity queries. In this paper, we present a novel disk-based ANN index, B+ANN, to address these issues: it first partitions input data into blocks containing semantically similar items, then builds an B+ tree variant to store blocks both in-memory and on disks, and finally, enables hybrid edge- and block-based in-memory traversals. As demonstrated by our experimantal evaluation, the proposed B+ANN disk-based index improves both quality (Recall value), and execution performance (Queries per second/QPS) over HNSW, by improving spatial and temporal locality for semantic operations, reducing cache misses (19.23% relative gain), and decreasing the memory consumption and disk-based build time by 24x over the DiskANN algorithm.

This dependence also presents a research opportunity: rather than adapt systems to interface demands, systems innovations and database theory can also inspire new interaction and visualization designs. We survey a decade of our lab's work that embraces this coupling and argue that HDI systems are the foundation for reliable, interactive, AI-driven applications."}

The RemoteOptiGraph allows OptiGraphs to be utilized in distributed memory environments through InterWorkerEdges, which manage linking constraints that span workers. This abstraction offers a unified approach for modeling optimization problems on distributed memory systems (avoiding bespoke modeling approaches), and provides a basis for developing general-purpose meta-algorithms that can exploit distributed memory structure such as Benders or Lagrangian decompositions. We implement this abstraction in the open-source package, Plasmo.jl and we illustrate how it can be used by solving a mixed integer capacity expansion model for the western United States containing over 12 million variables and constraints. The RemoteOptiGraph abstraction together with Benders decomposition performs 7.5 times faster than solving the same problem without decomposition."}

We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.\n  Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations."}

Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead.\n  NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support. The GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated backend leverages DOCA GPUNetIO for direct GPU-to-NIC communication, while the Proxy backend provides equivalent functionality via lock-free GPU-to-CPU queues over standard RDMA networks. We demonstrate GIN's practicality through integration with DeepEP, an MoE communication library. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that GIN provides device-initiated communication within NCCL's unified runtime, combining low-latency operations with NCCL's collective algorithms and production infrastructure."}

Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations).

While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.\n  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \\textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \\textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.\n  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses."}

Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly.\n  Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability.

In this framework, nodes are assigned labels, called certificates, which are supposed to prove that the property holds. The nodes then communicate with their neighbors to verify the correctness of these certificates.\n  Certifying that there is a unique leader in a network is one of the most classical problems in this setting. It is well-known that this can be done using certificates that encode node identifiers and distances in the graph. These require $O(\\log n)$ and $O(\\log D)$ bits respectively, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter. A matching lower bound is known in cycle graphs (where $n$ and $D$ are equal up to multiplicative constants).\n  A recent line of work has shown that network structure greatly influences local certification. For example, certifying that a network does not contain triangles takes $Θ(n)$ bits in general graphs, but only $O(\\log n)$ bits in graphs of bounded treewidth. This observation raises the question: Is it possible to achieve sublogarithmic leader certification in graph classes that do not contain cycle graphs?

To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows.

Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark.

To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with AUC gains of up to 102%. In addition, our method exhibits strong transferability across different models and datasets, underscoring its practical utility and generalizability."}

Among the essential aspects of such testing is the ability to interact with and validate web forms, a task that requires syntactically correct, executable scripts with high coverage of input fields. Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4o and other popular LLMs, across all evaluation metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for future research on LLM-based web testing and provides resources to support ongoing progress in this area."}

While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them. The contributions support developers in building more efficient and sustainable ML applications and offer a structured view of the underlying causes of resource leaks."}

Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework."}

With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more researchers are exploring approaches to software automation. They view AI systems as tools or assistants in software development, still requiring significant human involvement. Another initiative is ``vibe coding'', where AI systems write and repeatedly revise most (or even all) of the code. We foresee these two development paths will converge towards the same destination: AI systems participate in throughout the software development lifecycle, expanding boundaries of full-stack software development. In this paper, we present a vision of an iterative end-to-end automated software development paradigm AutoSW. It operates in an analyze-plan-implement-deliver loop, where AI systems as human partners become first-class actors, translating human intentions expressed in natural language into executable software. We explore a lightweight prototype across the paradigm and initially execute various representative cases. The results indicate that AutoSW can successfully deliver executable software, providing a feasible direction for truly end-to-end automated software development."}

A prerequisite is the specification of ML component requirements, including models and data, an area where traditional requirements engineering (RE) processes face new obstacles. An underexplored source of RE-relevant information in this context is ML documentation such as ModelCards and DataSheets. However, it is uncertain to what extent RE-relevant information can be extracted from these documents. This study first investigates the amount and nature of RE-relevant information in 20 publicly available ModelCards and DataSheets. We show that these documents contain a significant amount of potentially RE-relevant information. Next, we evaluate how effectively three established RE representations (EARS, Rupp's template, and Volere) can structure this knowledge into requirements. Our results demonstrate that there is a pathway to transform ML-specific knowledge into structured requirements, incorporating ML documentation in software engineering processes for ML systems."}

In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior.\n  We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening."}

To ensure system safety, an in-kernel safety checker, the verifier, enforces strict safety constraints (for example, a limited program size) on eBPF programs loaded into the kernel. These constraints, combined with eBPF's performance-critical use cases, make effective optimization essential. However, existing compilers (such as Clang) offer limited optimization support, and many semantics-preserving transformations are rejected by the verifier, which makes handcrafted optimization rule design both challenging and limited in effectiveness. Superoptimization overcomes the limitations of rule-based methods by automatically discovering optimal transformations, but its high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we propose EPSO, a caching-based superoptimizer that discovers rewrite rules via offline superoptimization and reuses them to achieve high-quality optimizations with minimal runtime overhead. We evaluate EPSO on benchmarks from the Linux kernel and several eBPF-based projects, including Cilium, Katran, hXDP, Sysdig, Tetragon, and Tracee. EPSO discovers 795 rewrite rules and achieves up to 68.87 percent (average 24.37 percent) reduction in program size compared to Clang's output, outperforming the state-of-the-art BPF optimizer K2 on all benchmarks and Merlin on 92.68 percent of them. Additionally, EPSO reduces program runtime by an average of 6.60 percent, improving throughput and lowering latency in network applications."}
