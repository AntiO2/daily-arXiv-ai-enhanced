To address the low inference efficiency of LLMs across diverse heterogeneous platforms, this paper proposes a practical optimization method, Opt4GPTQ, designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly optimization (ILAOpt), which directly leverages hardware-native vector halfprecision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions for efficient execution. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves inference performance across different models, achieving up to 84.42% throughput improvement and up to 51.35% latency reduction. This work highlights the critical role of platform-level engineering optimizations in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging heterogeneous AI acceleration architectures and provides valuable deployment experience and methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation."}

Using the locality of the FILO2 optimization applications, in FILO2$^x$ several possibly unrelated solution areas are concurrently asynchronously optimized. The overall search trajectory emerges as an iteration-based parallelism obtained by the simultaneous optimization of the same underlying solution performed by several solvers.

Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\\% lower latency, and 20\\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines. These results confirm that predictive, deterministic, and security-aware shard allocation is a promising direction for next-generation scalable blockchain systems."}

However, real-world adoption remains elusive due to the limited ability of traditional relational query operators to capture query semantics. The emergence of foundation models, particularly the large language models (LLMs), opens up new opportunities to develop flexible, semantic-aware data analytics systems that transcend the relational paradigm.\n  We present Nirvana, a multi-modal data analytics framework that incorporates programmable semantic operators while leveraging both logical and physical query optimization strategies, tailored for LLM-driven semantic query processing. Nirvana addresses two key challenges. First, it features an agentic logical optimizer that uses natural language-specified transformation rules and random-walk-based search to explore vast spaces of semantically equivalent query plans -- far beyond the capabilities of conventional optimizers. Second, it introduces a cost-aware physical optimizer that selects the most effective LLM backend for each operator using a novel improvement-score metric. To further enhance efficiency, Nirvana incorporates computation reuse and evaluation pushdown techniques guided by model capability hypotheses. Experimental evaluations on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that Nirvana is able to reduce end-to-end runtime by 10%--85% and reduces system processing costs by 76% on average, outperforming state-of-the-art systems at both efficiency and scalability."}

For optimal efficiency, analyzing each subtask and scheduling it on the best-suited hardware would be necessary. Other considerations must be taken into account, too, such as parallelism, dependencies between different subtasks, and data transfer speeds between devices. To achieve this, directed acyclic graphs are often employed to represent these problems and enable utilizing as much hardware as possible on a given machine. In this paper, we present a software framework written in Julia capable of automatically and dynamically producing statically scheduled and compiled code. We lay theoretical foundations and add domain-specific information about the computation to the existing concepts of DAG scheduling, enabling optimizations that would otherwise be impossible. To illustrate the theory we implement an example application: the computation of matrix elements for scattering processes with many external particles in quantum electrodynamics."}

To appear", "summary": "Diverse types of edge data, such as 2D geo-locations and 3D point clouds, are collected by sensors like lidar and GPS receivers on edge devices. On-device searches, such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search and radius search, are commonly used to enable fast analytics and learning technologies, such as k-means dataset simplification using kNN. To maintain high search efficiency, a representative approach is to utilize a balanced multi-way KD-tree (BMKD-tree). However, the index has shown limited gains, mainly due to substantial construction overhead, inflexibility to real-time insertion, and inconsistent query performance. In this paper, we propose UnIS to address the above limitations. We first accelerate the construction process of the BMKD-tree by utilizing the dataset distribution to predict the splitting hyperplanes. To make the continuously generated data searchable, we propose a selective sub-tree rebuilding scheme to accelerate rebalancing during insertion by reducing the number of data points involved. We then propose an auto-selection model to improve query performance by automatically selecting the optimal search strategy among multiple strategies for an arbitrary query task. Experimental results show that UnIS achieves average speedups of 17.96x in index construction, 1.60x in insertion, 7.15x in kNN search, and 1.09x in radius search compared to the BMKD-tree. We further verify its effectiveness in accelerating dataset simplification on edge devices, achieving a speedup of 217x over Lloyd's algorithm."}

However, with the rapid growth of enterprise-scale MCP services, efficiently and accurately matching target functionalities among thousands of heterogeneous tools has become a core challenge restricting system practicality. Existing approaches generally rely on full-prompt injection or static semantic retrieval, facing issues including semantic disconnection between user queries and tool descriptions, context inflation in LLM input, and high inference latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Z-Space, a data-generation-oriented multi-agent collaborative tool invocation framework Z-Space. The Z-Space framework establishes a multi-agent collaborative architecture and tool filtering algorithm: (1) A structured semantic understanding of user queries is achieved through an intent parsing model; (2) A tool filtering module (FSWW) based on fused subspace weighted algorithm realizes fine-grained semantic alignment between intents and tools without parameter tuning; (3) An inference execution agent is constructed to support dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution for multi-step tasks.

While edge-DP, which protects privacy at the edge level, has been extensively studied, node-DP, offering stronger protection for entire nodes and their incident edges, remains largely underexplored due to its technical challenges. A natural way to bridge this gap is to develop a general framework for reducing node-DP graph analytical tasks to edge-DP ones, enabling the reuse of existing edge-DP mechanisms. A straightforward solution based on group privacy divides the privacy budget by a given degree upper bound, but this leads to poor utility when the bound is set conservatively large to accommodate worst-case inputs. To address this, we propose node-to-edge (N2E), a general framework that reduces any node-DP graph analytical task to an edge-DP one, with the error dependency on the graph's true maximum degree. N2E introduces two novel techniques: a distance-preserving clipping mechanism that bounds edge distance between neighboring graphs after clipping, and the first node-DP mechanism for maximum degree approximation, enabling tight, privacy-preserving clipping thresholds. By instantiating N2E with existing edge-DP mechanisms, we obtain the first node-DP solutions for tasks such as maximum degree estimation. For edge counting, our method theoretically matches the error of the state-of-the-art, which is provably optimal, and significantly outperforms existing approaches for degree distribution estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves up to a 2.5x reduction in error for edge counting and up to an 80x reduction for degree distribution estimation."}

The Sun is by far the largest energy source in our solar system, and thus it warrants consideration how future AI infrastructure could most efficiently tap into that power. This work explores a scalable compute system for machine learning in space, using fleets of satellites equipped with solar arrays, inter-satellite links using free-space optics, and Google tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator chips. To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors. Launch costs are a critical part of overall system cost; a learning curve analysis suggests launch to low-Earth orbit (LEO) may reach $\\lesssim$\\$200/kg by the mid-2030s."}

The aim is to allow rewrites to alter the structure and syntactic outcome of an original query while keeping the obtainable insights intact. This drastically differs from traditional query rewriting, which typically aims to decrease query evaluation time by using strict equivalence rules and optimization heuristics on the query plan. Rewriting queries to queries that only provide a similar insight but otherwise can be entirely different can remedy inaccessible original data tables due to access control, privacy, or expensive data access regarding monetary cost or remote access. In this paper, we put forward INQURE, a system designed for INtent-based QUery REwriting. It uses access to a large language model (LLM) for the query understanding and human-like derivation of alternate queries. Around the LLM, INQURE employs upfront table filtering and subsequent candidate rewrite pruning and ranking. We report on the results of an evaluation using a benchmark set of over 900 database table schemas and discuss the pros and cons of alternate approaches regarding runtime and quality of the rewrites of a user study."}

MCIs mislead reviewers, hinder maintenance, contaminate research datasets, and may obscure security patches. Yet, no dedicated benchmark exists to evaluate models for MCI detection. We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level \"purpose\" inconsistencies. CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL provides a rigorous foundation for measuring, comparing, and advancing MCI detection, highlighting the need for richer context and balanced data to capture high-level semantic gaps."}

In this work, we present a federated learning framework built to run efficiently across mixed HPC and cloud environments. Our system addresses key challenges such as system het- erogeneity, communication overhead, and resource scheduling, while maintaining model accuracy and data privacy.

We introduce the Classes2Test dataset, which maps Java classes under test to their corresponding test classes, and a framework that integrates advanced evaluation metrics, such as mutation score and test smells, for a comprehensive assessment. Experimental results show that, for the subset of tests that compile, LLM-generated tests can match or exceed human-written tests in terms of coverage and defect detection. Our findings also demonstrate that enhanced prompting strategies contribute to test quality.

However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution."}

This paper presents AVS, an Autonomous Vehicle Storage system that co-designs computation with a hierarchical layout: modality-aware reduction and compression, hot-cold tiering with daily archival, and a lightweight metadata layer for indexing. The design is grounded with system-level benchmarks on AV data that cover SSD and HDD filesystems and embedded indexing, and is validated on embedded hardware with real L4 autonomous driving traces. The prototype delivers predictable real-time ingest, fast selective retrieval, and substantial footprint reduction under modest resource budgets.

Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity. Building on the batch solution, we further optimize bandwidth allocation across AIGC services. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in delivering high-quality, lower-latency AIGC services."}

Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \\emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework."}

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels.

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs."}
