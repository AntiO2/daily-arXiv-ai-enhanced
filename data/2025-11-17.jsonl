Advancements in deep learning and specialized hardware have driven the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. However, traditional GPU-centric architectures face scalability challenges for inference workloads due to limitations in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect scaling. To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure. FengHuang provides an optimal balance as a rack-level AI infrastructure scale-up solution. Its open, heterogeneous design eliminates vendor lock-in and enhances supply chain flexibility, enabling significant infrastructure and power cost reductions."}

This framework achieves automation, standardization, and visualization of the testing process through clear hierarchical decoupling. ResBench simulates adverse events and injects them during normal transaction processing, utilizing a module to gather multiple metrics for the evaluation model. We assess database resilience across eight dimensions: throughput, latency, stability, resistance, recovery, disturbance period, adaptation capability and metric deviation. All the results are presented to users via a user-friendly graphical interface. We demonstrate the execution process and result interpretation of ResBench using two types of adversity datasets."}

Building on prior work, it aims to uncover how RSEs insights differ from those of other research software developers and identify factors that can enhance code review adoption in this domain. Method: We surveyed RSEs to gather insights into their perspectives on peer code review. The survey design aligned with previous research to enable comparative analysis while including additional questions tailored to RSEs. Results: We received 61 valid responses from the survey. The findings align with prior research while uncovering unique insights about the challenges and practices of RSEs compared to broader developer groups.

However, a critical gap exists in the current way GDB-GML applications analyze data, especially in terms of Knowledge Completion (KC) in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In particular, current architectures ignore KC, working on datasets that appear incomplete or fragmented, despite they actually contain valuable hidden knowledge. This limitation may cause wrong interpretations when these data are used as input for GML models.\n  This paper proposes an innovative architecture that integrates a KC phase into GDB-GML applications, demonstrating how revealing hidden knowledge can heavily impact datasets' behavior and metrics. For this purpose, we introduce scalable transitive relationships, which are links that propagate information over the network and modelled by a decay function, allowing a deterministic knowledge flows across multiple nodes.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that our intuition radically reshapes both topology and overall dataset dynamics, underscoring the need for this new GDB-GML architecture to produce better models and unlock the full potential of graph-based data analysis."}

Determining validity can require costly manual annotation. To reduce this cost, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to LLM-based patch validity judgment. Inspired by the observation that human judgment is better aligned when using a shared rubric, we first employ an LLM to generate a per-bug rubric, followed by a one-time human review and optional refinement to this rubric, and then employ an LLM to judge patches using the refined rubric. We apply this approach to assign binary validity labels to patches for issues found by Google sanitizer tools. Our results show that this approach yields substantial agreement with human consensus (Cohen's kappa 0.75), high recall (0.94) and high precision (0.80), when considering patches that have unanimous agreement from 3 human raters on the validity labels. On the full dataset including patches where human raters disagree, we find this approach can still be further improved (Cohen's kappa 0.57, recall 0.93, precision 0.65) and identify possible future directions."}

Although systems are validated at design time, their behavior can be different at run-time, possibly showing control-flow anomalies due to \"unknown unknowns\".\n  Objective: We aim to detect control-flow anomalies through software monitoring, which verifies run-time behavior by logging software execution and detecting deviations from expected control flow.\n  Methods: We propose a methodology to develop software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through Large Language Models (LLMs) and conformance checking. The methodology builds on existing software development practices to maintain traditional V&V while providing an additional level of robustness and trustworthiness. It leverages LLMs to link design-time models and implementation code, automating source-code instrumentation. The resulting event logs are analyzed via conformance checking, an explainable and effective technique for control-flow anomaly detection.\n  Results: We test the methodology on a case-study scenario from the European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS), which is a railway standard for modern interoperable railways. The results obtained from the ERTMS/ETCS case study demonstrate that LLM-based source-code instrumentation can achieve up to 84.775% control-flow coverage of the reference design-time process model, while the subsequent conformance checking-based anomaly detection reaches a peak performance of 96.610% F1-score and 93.515% AUC.\n  Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to guide LLMs in source-code instrumentation significantly allowed obtaining reliable and quality software logs and enabled effective control-flow anomaly detection through conformance checking."}

Repairing these bugs requires coordinated edits across multiple, disjoint code regions, posing substantially greater challenges. We present the first systematic study of LLM-driven coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-cli, and Qwen Code) on this task. We evaluate these agents on 372 multi-hunk bugs from the Hunk4J dataset, analyzing 1,488 repair trajectories using fine-grained metrics that capture localization, repair accuracy, regression behavior, and operational dynamics. Results reveal substantial variation: repair accuracy ranges from 25.8% (Qwen Code) to 93.3% (Claude Code) and consistently declines with increasing bug dispersion and complexity. High-performing agents demonstrate superior semantic consistency, achieving positive regression reduction, whereas lower-performing agents often introduce new test failures. Notably, agents do not fail fast; failed repairs consume substantially more resources (39%-343% more tokens) and require longer execution time (43%-427%). Additionally, we developed Maple to provide agents with repository-level context. Empirical results show that Maple improves the repair accuracy of Gemini-cli by 30% through enhanced localization. By analyzing fine-grained metrics and trajectory-level analysis, this study moves beyond accuracy to explain how coding agents localize, reason, and act during multi-hunk repair."}

Within this paper, we study enterprises can achieve on their own without investing large amounts of effort into the training of models specific to the domain-specific languages that are used.

However, the risks associated with SCR usage violations have become a growing concern. One particular type of SCR usage violation, known as a logic-level usage violation, is becoming especially harmful. This violation occurs when the SCR adheres to its specified usage rules but fails to align with the specific business logic of the current context, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Detecting such violations necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the contract's business logic, including the ability to extract implicit usage patterns and analyze fine-grained logical behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose SCRUTINEER, the first automated and practical system for detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs. First, we design a composite feature extraction approach that produces three complementary feature representations, supporting subsequent analysis. We then introduce a Large Language Model-powered knowledge construction framework, which leverages comprehension-oriented prompts and domain-specific tools to extract logic-level usage and build the SCR knowledge base. Next, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-driven inspector, which combines a rapid retrieval strategy with both comprehensive and targeted analysis to identify potentially insecure logic-level usages. Finally, we implement a logic-level usage violation analysis engine that integrates a similarity-based checker and a snapshot-based inference conflict checker to enable accurate and robust detection. We evaluate SCRUTINEER from multiple perspectives on 3 ground-truth datasets. The results show that SCRUTINEER achieves a precision of 80.77%, a recall of 82.35%, and an F1-score of 81.55% in detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs."}

However, integrating Agile methods into safety-critical system development in the aerospace industry presents substantial challenges due to its strict compliance requirements, such as those outlined in the DO-178C standard. To achieve this vision, the flexibility of Agile must align with the rigorous certification guidelines, which emphasize documentation, traceability of requirements across different levels and disciplines, and comprehensive verification and validation (V&V) activities. The research work described in this paper proposes a way of using the strengths of the flexible nature of Agile methods to automate and manage change requests throughout the whole software development lifecycle, ensuring robust traceability, regulatory compliance and ultimately facilitating successful certification. This study proposes CertiA360, a tool designed to help teams improve requirement maturity, automate the changes in traceability, and align with the regulatory objectives. The tool was designed and validated in close collaboration with aerospace industry experts, using their feedback to ensure practical application and real-life effectiveness. The feedback collected demonstrated that the automation given by CertiA360 may reduce manual effort and allow response to changing requirements while ensuring compliance with DO-178C. While the tool is not yet qualified under DO-330 (Tool Qualification), findings suggest that when tailored appropriately, Agile methods can not only coexist with the requirements of safety-system development and certification in highly regulated domains like aerospace, but also add efficiency."}
