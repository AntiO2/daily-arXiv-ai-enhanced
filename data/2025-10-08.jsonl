We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that\nrecasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our\nmethod is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that\nfuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample\nefficiency and robustness.

Extensive simulation studies\ndemonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and\noptimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance.

These\nagents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be\ncompromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a\nmechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined\nsafety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We\nintroduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees\nfor LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and\nverifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive\nvalidation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise\nsafety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and\nsubjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance\nwith these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it\nis deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action\nmonitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each\nproposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This\nseparation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online\nmonitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a\nrobust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents."}

In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design\ninference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models\ninto modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its\nideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into\nmodular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.\nIt performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on\nunified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level\nscheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our\nframework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs\nentirely on device.

This paper argues that the\nprevailing time-based pricing models for cloud GPUs are economically\ninefficient for bandwidth-bound workloads. These models fail to account for the\nrising marginal cost of memory bandwidth, leading to market distortions and\nsuboptimal hardware allocation. To address this, we propose a novel\nfeature-based pricing framework that directly links cost to resource\nconsumption, including but not limited to memory bandwidth. We provide a robust\neconomic and algorithmic definition of this framework and introduce Agora, a\npractical and secure system architecture for its implementation.

However, critical evidence highlights challenges with\nfully remote arrangements, particularly for software teams. This study\ninvestigates employee resignation patterns at Ericsson, a global developer of\nsoftware-intensive systems, before, during, and after the pandemic. Using HR\ndata from 2016-2025 in Ericsson Sweden, we analyze how different work\nmodalities (onsite, remote, and hybrid) influence employee retention. Our\nfindings show a marked increase in resignations from summer 2021 to summer\n2023, especially among employees with less than five years of tenure. Employees\nonboarded remotely during the pandemic were significantly more likely to resign\nwithin their first three years, even after returning to the office. Exit\nsurveys suggest that remote onboarding may fail to establish the necessary\norganizational attachment, the feeling of belonging and long-term retention. By\ncontrast, the company's eventual successful return to pre-pandemic retention\nrates illustrates the value of differentiated work policies and supports\nreconsidering selective return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Our study demonstrates\nthe importance of employee integration practices in hybrid environments where\nthe requirement for in-office presence for recent hires shall be accompanied by\nin-office presence from their team members and more senior staff whose\nmentoring and social interactions contribute to integration into the corporate\nwork environment. We hope these actionable insights will inform HR leaders and\npolicymakers in shaping post-pandemic work practices, demonstrating that\ncarefully crafted hybrid models anchored in organizational attachment and\nmentorship can sustain retention in knowledge-intensive companies."}

In\nthis work, we revisit the pipeline scheduling problem from a principled\noptimization perspective.

To address\nthis, we formulate scheduling as a constrained optimization problem that\njointly accounts for memory capacity, activation reuse, and pipeline bubble\nminimization. Solving this model yields fine-grained schedules that reduce\npipeline bubbles while adhering to strict memory budgets. Our approach\ncomplements existing offloading techniques: whereas prior approaches trade\nmemory for time in a fixed pattern, we dynamically optimize the tradeoff with\nrespect to model structure and hardware configuration. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method consistently improves both throughput and memory\nutilization.
