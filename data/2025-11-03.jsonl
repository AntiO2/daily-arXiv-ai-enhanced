Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none\nof the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key\ncapabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data\ncollection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that\nanswers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain\ndata. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single\npipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative\nof DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories\nof tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100\ninstances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have\ngained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of\nopen-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following\nDRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by\ncoordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs\nstructured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on\nDRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot\nachieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines\nwith up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost. DRAMA is\npublicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/drama."}

Existing\nbenchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness, overlooking the diversity\nof real-world coding tasks and developer expectations. To this end, we\nintroduce a multi-language benchmark that evaluates LLM instruction-following\ncapabilities and is extensible to operate on any set of standalone coding\nproblems. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following in two key settings:\nadherence to pre-defined constraints specified with the initial problem, and\nthe ability to perform refinements based on follow-up instructions. For this\npaper's analysis, we empirically evaluated our benchmarking pipeline with\nprogramming tasks from LiveBench, that are also automatically translated from\nPython into Java and JavaScript. Our automated benchmark reveals that models\nexhibit differing levels of performance across multiple dimensions of\ninstruction-following. Our benchmarking pipeline provides a more comprehensive\nevaluation of code generation models, highlighting their strengths and\nlimitations across languages and generation goals."}

In these scenarios, users often prefer\ndiverse result sets to minimize redundancy and enhance information value.\nHowever, existing greedy-based diverse methods frequently yield sub-optimal\nresults, failing to adequately approximate the optimal similarity score under\ncertain diversification level. Furthermore, there is a need for flexible\nalgorithms that can adapt to varying user-defined result sizes and diversity\nrequirements.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that seamlessly\nintegrates result diversification into state-of-the-art (SOTA) A$k$-NNS\nmethods. Our approach introduces a progressive search framework, consisting of\niterative searching, diversification, and verification phases. Carefully\ndesigned diversification and verification steps enable our approach to\nefficiently approximate the optimal diverse result set according to\nuser-specified diversification levels without additional indexing overhead.\n  We evaluate our method on three million-scale benchmark datasets, LAION-art,\nDeep1M, and Txt2img, using latency, similarity, and recall as performance\nmetrics across a range of $k$ values and diversification thresholds.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently retrieves\nnear-optimal diverse results with minimal latency overhead, particularly under\nmedium and high diversity settings."}

Although\nexisting approaches have addressed variability management in SPLs and the\nintegration of ML components in isolated systems, few have explored the\nintersection of both domains. Specifically, there is limited support for\nmodeling and managing variability in SPLs that incorporate ML components.

However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task\nfor LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning\n(ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct\nanswers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However,\nchoosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model\nperformance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot\nexamples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first\ncriterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a\nsample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about\nits usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity\nof the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples\nbased on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations\nto determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under\nvarious combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets."}
