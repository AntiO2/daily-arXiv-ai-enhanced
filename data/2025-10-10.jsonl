To\novercome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit\ncardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these\ndependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven\ncardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw\ndata access, query logs, or retraining on the target database.

Existing approaches either fully refactor the codebase or\nuse plugin-based GPU solvers, each facing trade-offs between performance and\ndevelopment effort. In this work, we address the limitations of plugin-based\nGPU acceleration in OpenFOAM by proposing a repartitioning strategy that better\nbalances CPU matrix assembly and GPU-based linear solves. We present a detailed\ncomputational model, describe a novel matrix repartitioning and update\nprocedure, and evaluate its performance on large-scale CFD simulations. Our\nresults show that the proposed method significantly mitigates oversubscription\nissues, improving solver performance and resource utilization in heterogeneous\nCPU-GPU environments."}
