However, these traditional methods fall short in\naddressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique\ncharacteristics of these agents.

While researchers have proposed text-based differencing\ntechniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing\nmethods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that\noperate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in\ndevelopers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or\nduplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent\nsuch block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling\ndevelopers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the\nefficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a\ntext-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of\nblock-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional\ndifferencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all\npossible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres\nalgorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size\nof the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's\nintent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five\nstate-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines\nand adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their\nperformance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental\nresults show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than\nbaseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our\nexperiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks\nregarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime\nefficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool."}

However, there are some barriers that\nprevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the\nmajor cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms\nthat ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.\nHowever, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud\nprovider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined\nto ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are\nbound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and\nprevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud\nenvironments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically\ntranslating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured\nacross multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent\nknowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs\ndefined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral\nmetrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system).\nSecondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can\nbe measured for the different cloud providers. Finally, we report a validation\nbased on two use cases (IaaS and PaaS) in a multi-cloud environment formed by\nleading cloud providers. This evaluation has demonstrated that, thanks to the\ncomplementarity of the two solutions, cloud consumers can automatically and\ntransparently exploit the multi-cloud in many application domains, as endorsed\nby the cloud experts consulted in the course of this study."}

To address these\nchallenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to\noptimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique\nquality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as\ncrashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.\nUnfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these\nquality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as\nthese models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor\nprocessing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature\nextraction.

We assign semantic names to computations to\nmatch requests with named Kubernetes (K8s) service endpoints. We show that this\napproach provides multiple benefits. First, it allows placement of\ncomputational jobs to be independent of location, enabling any cluster with\nsufficient resources to execute the computation. Second, it facilitates dynamic\ncompute placement without requiring prior knowledge of cluster locations or\npredefined configurations."}

The concept is in use for the first time on the German satellite\ncommunications mission Heinrich Hertz on behalf of the German Space Agency at\nDLR. Heinrich Hertz was launched in July 2023 and offers access to scientific\nand technical experiments to its users. The mission utilizes major automation\nconcepts for the satellite platform operations, allowing fully automated\noperations outside of office hours. The concept includes tracking, telemetry\nand commanding (TTC) of the satellite. Pre-planned and automatically executed\nschedules enable commanding without human interaction. The user mission\nschedule is planned separately from the main mission schedule and is\nautomatically de-conflicted. The automatic monitoring concept monitors the\nsystems of the satellite and all assets in the ground segment and triggers\nreactions in operator-configurable ways depending on the mission needs, for\nexample emergency notifications or automated execution of flight operation\nprocedures. Additionally, the concept also puts special emphasis on a\nself-service user portal that provides flexible access 24/7, even when the\ncontrol center is not staffed. The portal allows external users of the payload\nto schedule pre-defined experiments, monitor the live execution of the\nexperiment with browser-based displays and access ground station telemetry and\ndedicated RF test equipment during the time of their scheduled experiment.\nTasks can be planned long in advance as well as with a short reaction time\n(less than 1 minute), which allows, for example, the reconfiguration of the\npayload during a running experiment."}

These factors are typically not captured by\ntraditional host-level metrics like CPU or memory. Scheduling without\naccounting for these conditions can lead to poor placement decisions, longer\ndata transfers, and suboptimal job performance. We present a network-aware job\nscheduler that uses supervised learning to predict the completion time of\ncandidate jobs. Our system introduces a prediction-and-ranking mechanism that\ncollects real-time telemetry from all nodes, uses a trained supervised model to\nestimate job duration per node, and ranks them to select the best placement. We\nevaluate the scheduler on a geo-distributed Kubernetes cluster deployed on the\nFABRIC testbed by running network-intensive Spark workloads. Compared to the\ndefault Kubernetes scheduler, which makes placement decisions based on current\nresource availability alone, our proposed supervised scheduler achieved 34-54%\nhigher accuracy in selecting optimal nodes for job placement. The novelty of\nour work lies in the demonstration of supervised learning for real-time,\nnetwork-aware job scheduling on a multi-site cluster."}

Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and\nconjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There\nis little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification\nobjectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the\ncomplex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In\nthis study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system\nspecification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:\nWe reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with\npractitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the\nunderlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We\ndeveloped and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification\nfor PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The\nrelationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is\ninstrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the\nmodeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to\nspecification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification\ntransparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed\nthroughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to\nachieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in\nspecifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure\ncompliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to\naddress practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future\neffective operationalization of the approach."}

The most standard variant of the\nproblem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\\Delta+1$ colors,\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of\nwork on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining\nthe deterministic complexity of $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message\npassing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In\nthis paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity\nof $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\\Delta$ in a special family of\ngraphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The\nneighborhood independence $\\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise\nnon-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of\nneighborhood independence $\\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that\n$(\\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log\\Delta})}+O(\\log^* n)$\nrounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show\nthat in graphs of neighborhood independence $\\theta$, a $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring\ncan be computed in $(\\theta\\cdot\\log\\Delta)^{O(\\log\\log\\Delta /\n\\log\\log\\log\\Delta)}+O(\\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time\nin $\\Delta$ as long as $\\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\\Delta$. We also\nshow that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\\Delta$\nalgorithm for $(2\\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of\nhypergraphs of rank at least $3$."}
