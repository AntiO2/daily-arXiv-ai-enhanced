To address load imbalance across GPUs in EP, existing approaches aim to balance the number of tokens each GPU processes. Surprisingly, we find that this objective degrades performance rather than improving it when processing is memory-bound - a common occurrence in MoE serving, especially in the decode phase. Our analysis reveals that balancing the number of tokens processed per GPU increases the number of activated experts, exacerbating memory pressure in the memory-bound regime.\n  We propose Minimum Expert Token ROuting, a novel token-routing algorithm for high-performance expert-parallel MoE serving in the memory-bound regime that balances the number of activated experts per GPU rather than token counts. METRO achieves near-optimal routing quality with minimal computational overhead by jointly optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power. To guarantee routing quality, METRO also employs a novel allGather scheme to gather global top-k knowledge, which has minimal overhead compared to conventional allToAll. Our evaluation of METRO against EPLB on both real systems (vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs) and a proprietary simulator (8-16 B200 GPUs) shows that METRO reduces decode latency by 11 - 22%, and total token throughput by 3 - 21% for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V3 serving, where prefill and decode phases are co-deployed. In addition, by trading latency headroom for throughput, METRO improves decode throughput by up to 4.11x over EPLB at a fixed decode SLO."}

However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum."}

The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD.

As data dimensionality grows, optimization time can even exceed actual query execution time. Furthermore, inference with probabilistic models by sampling or integration procedures unpredictable estimation result and violate stability, which brings unstable performance with query execution and make database tuning hard for database users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to cardinality estimation based on cumulative distribution function(CDF), which calculates range query cardinality without sampling or integration, ensuring accurate and predictable estimation results. With inference acceleration by merging calculations, we can achieve fast and nearly constant inference speed while maintaining high accuracy, even as dimensionality increases, which is over 10x faster than current state-of-the-art data-driven cardinality estimator. This demonstrates its excellent dimensional scalability, making it well-suited for real-world database applications."}

Exqutor is a pluggable cardinality estimation framework designed to address this issue, leveraging exact cardinality query optimization techniques to enhance estimation accuracy when vector indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF) are available.

Although numerous scheduling solutions exist, they predominantly optimize singular or limited metrics such as execution time or resource utilization often neglecting the need for comprehensive multi-objective optimization. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Optimization Algorithm (PHWSOA). This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), specifically mitigating WOA's limitations in local exploitation and SOA's constraints in global exploration. Leveraging Pareto dominance principles, PHWSOA simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: makespan, virtual machine (VM) load balancing, and economic cost. Key enhancements include: Halton sequence initialization for superior population diversity, a Pareto-guided mutation mechanism to avert premature convergence, and parallel processing for accelerated convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic VM load redistribution mechanism is integrated to improve load balancing during task execution. Extensive experiments conducted on the CloudSim simulator, utilizing real-world workload traces from NASA-iPSC and HPC2N, demonstrate that PHWSOA delivers substantial performance gains. Specifically, it achieves up to a 72.1% reduction in makespan, a 36.8% improvement in VM load balancing, and 23.5% cost savings. These results substantially outperform baseline methods including WOA, GA, PEWOA, and GCWOA underscoring PHWSOA's strong potential for enabling efficient resource management in practical cloud environments."}

We use operational differencing to construct an operation-based form of version control on data structures used in programming languages and relational databases.\n  This approach to data version control does fine-grained diffing and merging despite intervening structural transformations like schema changes. It offers users a simplified conceptual model of version control for ad hoc usage: There is no repo; Branching is just copying. The informaton maintained in a repo can be synthesized more precisely from the append-only histories of branches. Branches can be flexibly shared as is commonly done with document files, except with the added benefit of diffing and merging.\n  We conjecture that queries can be operationalized into a sequence of schema and data operations. We develop that idea on a query language fragment containing selects and joins.\n  Operationalized queries are represented as a future timeline that is speculatively executed as a branch off of the present state, returning a value from its hypothetical future. Operationalized queries get rewritten to accommodate schema change \"for free\" by the machinery of operational differencing.\n  Altogether we develop solutions to four of the eight challenge problems of schema evolution identified in a recent paper."}

In issue tracking systems such as JIRA, each bug report is assigned a priority level to indicate the urgency and importance level of the bug. The priority may change during the bug fixing process, indicating that the urgency and importance level of the bug will change with the bug fixing. However, manually evaluating priority changes for bugs is a tedious process that heavily relies on the subjective judgment of developers and project managers, leading to incorrect priority changes and thus hindering timely bug fixes. Given the lack of research on bug priority change prediction, we propose a novel two-phase bug report priority change prediction method based on bug fixing evolution features and class imbalance handling strategy. Specifically, we divided the bug lifecycle into two phases: bug reporting and bug fixing, and constructed bug priority change prediction models for each phase. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on a bug dataset constructed from 32 non-trivial Apache projects. The experimental results show that our proposed bug fixing evolution features and the adopted class imbalance handling strategy can effectively improve the performance of prediction models. The F1-score of the prediction model constructed for the bug reporting phase reached 0.798, while the F1-weighted and F1-macro of the prediction model constructed for the bug fixing phase were 0.712 and 0.613, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the cross-project applicability of our prediction models and their performance at different priority levels. The findings indicate large variations in model performance across different projects, although the overall scores remain decent. Meanwhile, the predictive performance across various priority levels remained relatively consistently high."}

Additionally, existing mitigation methods that switch from synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) to asynchronous SGD (ASGD) may not improve Time-To-Accuracy (TTA) and can even generate more stragglers due to its higher resource consumption. To address these newly found problems, we propose the Straggler Tolerant And Resilient DL training system (STAR). STAR includes new synchronization modes that group workers for each parameter updating. It has a heuristic and an ML method to choose the optimal synchronization mode for minimizing TTA, and reallocates resources to support the selected mode while minimizing the impact on co-located jobs. Moreover, it proactively prevents stragglers by avoiding overloading the CPU and bandwidth resources in allocating PSs (which consume high CPU and bandwidth) and in gradient transmission. Our trace-driven evaluation on AWS shows that STAR generates 48-84% and 51-70% lower TTA than state-of-the-art systems in the PS and all-reduce architectures, respectively, while maintaining the converged accuracy of SSGD.

This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.\n  Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.\n  Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.\n  Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.\n  Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning.

We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph."}

Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment."}

We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \\emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity."}

However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The results presented demonstrate the relevance of the approach, and we discuss in detail the assistance provided to domain experts."}
