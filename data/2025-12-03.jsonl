To achieve high recall and low latency, GPUs are utilized to exploit massive parallelism for faster query processing. However, as the number of vectors continues to grow, the graph size quickly exceeds the memory capacity of a single GPU, making it infeasible to store and process the entire index on a single GPU. Recent work uses CPU-GPU architectures to keep vectors in CPU memory or SSDs, but the loading step stalls GPU computation. We present Fantasy, an efficient system that pipelines vector search and data transfer in a GPU cluster with GPUDirect Async. Fantasy overlaps computation and network communication to significantly improve search throughput for large graphs and deliver large query batch sizes."}

DOLMA intelligently identifies and offloads data objects to remote memory, while pro- viding quantitative analysis to decide a suitable local memory size. Furthermore, DOLMA leverages the predictable memory access patterns typical in HPC applications and enables remote memory prefetch via a dual-buffer design. By carefully balancing local and remote memory usage and maintaining multi-thread concurrency, DOLMA provides a flexible and efficient solution for leveraging dis- aggregated memory in HPC domains while minimally compromis- ing application performance. Evaluating with eight HPC workloads and computational kernels, DOLMA limits performance degrada- tion to less than 16% while reducing local memory usage by up to 63%, on average."}

Traditional cloud-based architectures struggle to handle the sheer volume and velocity of AI-driven data, leading to inefficiencies in storage, computation, and data movement. This paper explores the integration of active storage systems within the computing continuum to optimize AI workload distribution.\n  By embedding computation directly into storage architectures, active storage is able to reduce data transfer overhead, enhancing performance and improving resource utilization. Other existing frameworks and architectures offer mechanisms to distribute certain AI processes across distributed environments; however, they lack the flexibility and adaptability that the continuum requires, both regarding the heterogeneity of devices and the rapid-changing algorithms and models being used by domain experts and researchers.\n  This article proposes a software architecture aimed at seamlessly distributing AI workloads across the computing continuum, and presents its implementation using mainstream Python libraries and dataClay, an active storage platform. The evaluation shows the benefits and trade-offs regarding memory consumption, storage requirements, training times, and execution efficiency across different devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the process of offloading workloads through active storage significantly improves memory efficiency and training speeds while maintaining accuracy. Our findings highlight the potential of active storage to revolutionize AI workload management, making distributed AI deployments more scalable and resource-efficient with a very low entry barrier for domain experts and application developers."}

Instead of focusing only on one type of information, Bin2Vec combines what a program looks like (its built-in functions, imports, and exports) with how it behaves when it runs (its instructions and memory usage). This gives a more complete picture when deciding whether two programs are similar or not. Bin2Vec represents these different types of information as views that can be inspected separately using easy-to-read charts, and then brings them together into an overall similarity score. Bin2Vec acts as a bridge between binary representations and machine learning techniques by generating feature representations that can be efficiently processed by machine-learning models. We tested Bin2Vec on multiple versions of two well-known Windows programs, PuTTY and 7-Zip. The primary results strongly confirmed that our method compute an optimal and visualization-friendly representation of the analyzed software. For example, PuTTY versions showed more complex behavior and memory activity, while 7-Zip versions focused more on performance-related patterns. Overall, Bin2Vec provides decisions that are both reliable and explainable to humans. Because it is modular and easy to extend, it can be applied to tasks like auditing, verifying software origins, or quickly screening large numbers of programs in cybersecurity and reverse-engineering work."}

However, this approach is not scalable, as it places a heavy load on the sender. This work presents an autonomic algorithm that enables the $n$ processes in a distributed system to build and maintain a spanning tree connecting themselves. In this context, processes are the vertices of the spanning tree. By definition, a spanning tree connects all processes without forming cycles. The proposed algorithm ensures that every vertex in the spanning tree has both an in-degree and the tree depth of at most $log_2 n$. When all processes are correct, the degree of each process is exactly $log_2 n$. A spanning tree is dynamically created from any source process and is transparently reconstructed as processes fail or recover. Up to $n-1$ processes can fail, and the correct processes remain connected through a scalable, functioning spanning tree. To build and maintain the tree, processes use the VCube virtual topology, which also serves as a failure detector. Two broadcast algorithms based on the autonomic spanning tree algorithm are presented: one for best-effort broadcast and one for reliable broadcast. Simulation results are provided, including comparisons with other alternatives."}

These centers operate with hardware configurations, software environments, and security requirements that differ substantially from most users' local systems. As a result, users often develop customized digital artifacts that are tightly coupled to a given HPC center. This practice can lead to significant duplication of effort as multiple users independently create similar solutions to common problems. The FAIR Principles offer a framework to address these challenges. Initially designed to improve data stewardship, the FAIR approach has since been extended to encompass software, workflows, models, and infrastructure. By encouraging the use of rich metadata and community standards, FAIR practices aim to make digital artifacts easier to share and reuse, both within and across scientific domains. Many FAIR initiatives have emerged within individual research communities, often aligned by discipline (e.g. bioinformatics, earth sciences). These communities have made progress in adopting FAIR practices, but their domain-specific nature can lead to silos that limit broader collaboration. Thus, we propose that HPC centers play a more active role in fostering FAIR ecosystems that support research across multiple disciplines. This requires designing infrastructure that enables researchers to discover, share, and reuse computational components more effectively. Here, we build on the architecture of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) EOSC-Life FAIR Workflows Collaboratory to propose a model tailored to the needs of HPC. Rather than focusing on entire workflows, we emphasize the importance of making individual workflow components FAIR. This component-based approach better supports the diverse and evolving needs of HPC users while maximizing the long-term value of their work."}

Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.\n  Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories."}

In DocETL, users build pipelines by composing operators described in natural language, also known as semantic operators, with an LLM executing each operator's logic. However, due to complexity in the operator or the data it operates on, LLMs often give inaccurate results. To address this challenge, DocETL introduced rewrite directives, or abstract rules that guide LLM agents in rewriting pipelines by decomposing operators or data. For example, decomposing a single filter(\"is this email sent from an executive and discussing fraud?\") into the conjunction of two separate semantic filters may improve accuracy. However, DocETL only optimizes for accuracy, not cost. How do we optimize for both?\n  We present MOAR (Multi-Objective Agentic Rewrites), a new optimizer for DocETL. To target cost optimization, we introduce two new categories of directives and extend all three existing categories with new ones, bringing the total to over 30 directives -- more than doubling what DocETL originally had. Moreover, since operators can interact with each other unpredictably due to LLM behavior, optimizing operators or sub-pipelines individually can yield suboptimal overall plans. Recognizing this, we design a new global search algorithm that explores rewrites in the context of entire pipelines. Since the space of rewrites is infinite -- pipelines can be rewritten in many ways, and each rewritten pipeline can itself be rewritten -- our algorithm adapts a multi-armed bandit framework to prioritize which pipelines to rewrite. Across six workloads, MOAR achieves 27% higher accuracy than ABACUS, the next-best optimizer, while matching its best accuracy at 55% of its cost."}

While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes.\n  We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system. Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees. The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables.\n  Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success. However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish. We observe this for the average performance of the system as well as its robustness under code perturbations. Finally, we also identify that diversity provided by code perturbations can even result in improved system performance."}

Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing. These results demonstrate that transformation learning and reuse can make join discovery both more accurate and more efficient."}

In this study, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the company's current development processes and practices, as well as the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the migration. Key stakeholders involved in software development participated in this evaluation to provide insight into their perceptions of the migration and their potential resistance to change.

Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections."}

We organized an inclusive event at a Brazilian public university with 31 undergraduate participants from computing and non-computing disciplines, divided into nine teams. Through observations, an exit survey, and semi-structured interviews, we examined creative processes, tool usage patterns, collaboration dynamics, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal that vibe coding enabled rapid prototyping and cross-disciplinary collaboration, with participants developing prompt engineering skills and delivering functional demonstrations within time constraints. However, we observed premature convergence in ideation, uneven code quality requiring rework, and limited engagement with core software engineering practices. Teams adopted sophisticated workflows combining multiple AI tools in pipeline configurations, with human judgment remaining essential for critical refinement. The short format (9 hours) proved effective for confidence-building among newcomers while accommodating participants with limited availability.

These structures make observation data analyzable offline and reusable, but they do not by themselves provide persistence, evolution, or interactive analytics at scale. In this paper, therefore, we introduce observation lakehouses that operationalize continual SRCs: a tall, append-only observations table storing every actuation (stimulus, response, context) and SQL queries that materialize SRC slices on demand. Built on Apache Parquet + Iceberg + DuckDB, the lakehouse ingests data from controlled pipelines (LASSO) and CI pipelines (e.g., unit test executions), enabling n-version assessment, behavioral clustering, and consensus oracles without re-execution. On a 509-problem benchmark, we ingest $\\approx$8.6M observation rows ($<$51MiB) and reconstruct SRM/SRC views and clusters in $<$100ms on a laptop, demonstrating that continual behavior mining is practical without a distributed cluster of machines. This makes behavioral ground truth first-class alongside other run-time data and provides an infrastructure path toward behavior-aware evaluation and training. The Observation Lakehouse, together with the accompanying dataset, is publicly available as an open-source project on GitHub: https://github.com/SoftwareObservatorium/observation-lakehouse"}

Paz"], "title": "From Administrative Chaos to Analytical Cohorts: A Three-Stage Normalisation Pipeline for Longitudinal University Administrative Records", "comment": "21 pages, 2 figures , 3 tables", "summary": "The growing use of longitudinal university administrative records in data-driven decision-making often overlooks a critical layer: how raw, inconsistent data are normalised before modelling. This article presents a three-stage normalisation pipeline for a dataset of 24,133 engineering students at a Latin American public university, spanning four decades (1980-2019). The pipeline comprises: (i) N1 CENSAL, harmonising demographics into a single person-level layer; (ii) N1b IDENTITY RESOLUTION, consolidating duplicate identifiers into a canonical ID while preserving an audit trail; and (iii) N1c GEO and SECONDARY-SCHOOL NORMALISATION, which builds reference tables, classifies school types (state national, state provincial, private secular, private religious), and flags irrecoverable cases as DATA_MISSING. The pipeline preserves 100% of students, achieves full geocoding, and yields valid school types for 56.6% of the population. The remaining 43.4% are identified as structurally missing due to legacy enrolment practices rather than stochastic non-response. Forensic analysis (chi-square, logistic regression) shows missingness is highly predictable from entry decade and geography, confirming a structural, historically induced mechanism. The article contributes: (a) a transparent, reproducible normalisation pipeline tailored to higher education; (b) a framework for treating structurally missing information without speculative imputation; and (c) guidance on defining analytically coherent cohorts (full population vs. secondary-school-informed subcohorts) for downstream learning analytics and policy evaluation."}

Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults.\n  This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain. Furthermore, CFaults produces only subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses (e.g., BugAssist and SNIPER)."}

An interplay between constraints, tinkering, and frequency-dependent selection drives the complex evolutionary trajectories of these socio-technological systems. Our approach integrates agent-based modeling and case studies, drawing on complex network analysis and evolutionary theory to explore how software evolves under the competing forces of novelty generation and imitation. By examining the evolution of programming languages and their impact on developer practices, we illustrate how technological artifacts co-evolve with and shape societal norms, cultural dynamics, and human interactions. This ecological perspective also informs our analysis of the emerging role of AI-driven development tools in software evolution. While large language models (LLMs) provide unprecedented access to information, their widespread adoption introduces new evolutionary pressures that may contribute to cultural stagnation, much like the decline of diversity in past software ecosystems. Understanding the evolutionary pressures introduced by AI-mediated software production is critical for anticipating broader patterns of cultural change, technological adaptation, and the future of software innovation."}
