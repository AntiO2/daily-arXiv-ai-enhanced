The versatile\nnature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the\nperformance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown\nthat they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these\nfaulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs.\nOne obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which\nnecessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors.\nMetamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this\noracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define\nrelationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty\nbehaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This\npaper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We\nconducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We\nimplemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments\nwith three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The\nresults shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as\nwell as its limitations."}

Although recent advances in language models further enhance this\nprocess, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack\nof explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design\nthat relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking\nfine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this\ngap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark\ndesigned to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note\ngeneration. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories\nacross 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three\nlevels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from\ncommit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and\n(3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs.

But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously\nspecified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos*\n-- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical\ncontribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously\nproved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the\nwhole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \\ge \\max\\{2e+f-1,\n2f+1\\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal."}
