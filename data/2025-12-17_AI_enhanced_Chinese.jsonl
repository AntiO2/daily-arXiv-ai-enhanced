However, efficient task offloading and resource allocation for time-critical applications in VEC remain challenging due to constrained network bandwidth and computational resources, stringent task deadlines, and rapidly changing network conditions. To address these challenges, we formulate a Deadline-Constrained Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Problem (DOAP), denoted as $\\mathbf{P}$, in VEC with both bandwidth and computational resource constraints, aiming to maximize the total vehicle utility. To solve $\\mathbf{P}$, we propose $\\mathtt{SARound}$, an approximation algorithm based on Linear Program rounding and local-ratio techniques, that improves the best-known approximation ratio for DOAP from $\\frac{1}{6}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we design an online service subscription and offloading control framework to address the challenges of short task deadlines and rapidly changing wireless network conditions. To validate our approach, we develop a comprehensive VEC simulator, VecSim, using the open-source simulation libraries OMNeT++ and Simu5G. VecSim integrates our designed framework to manage the full life-cycle of real-time vehicular tasks. Experimental results, based on profiled object detection applications and real-world taxi trace data, show that $\\mathtt{SARound}$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying network conditions while maintaining runtime efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSARound\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06VEC\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4ece1/6\u63d0\u5347\u52301/4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u8ba2\u9605\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f66\u8f7d\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u9762\u4e34\u7f51\u7edc\u5e26\u5bbd\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u4e25\u683c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898(DOAP)\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u820d\u5165\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6bd4\u7387\u6280\u672f\u7684SARound\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u8ba2\u9605\u548c\u5378\u8f7d\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b4) \u5f00\u53d1VecSim\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u96c6\u6210OMNeT++\u548cSimu5G\u3002", "result": "SARound\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06DOAP\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4ece1/6\u63d0\u5347\u52301/4\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SARound\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VEC\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This decentralization is achieved through the implementation of microservice architectures, which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA) such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure SLA compliance. This is achieved by sophisticated orchestration strategies such as Kubernetes, which help facilitate resource management. The orchestration strategies alone do not guarantee SLA adherence due to the inherent delay of scaling resources. Existing auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to address these challenges, but they suffer from performance issues and configuration complexity. In this paper, a novel auto-scaling algorithm is proposed for SLA-constrained edge computing applications. This approach combines a Machine Learning (ML) based proactive auto-scaling algorithm, capable of predicting incoming resource requests to forecast demand, with a reactive autoscaler which considers current resource utilization and SLA constraints for immediate adjustments. The algorithm is integrated into Kubernetes as an extension, and its performance is evaluated through extensive experiments in an edge environment with real applications. The results demonstrate that existing solutions have an SLA violation rate of up to 23%, whereas the proposed hybrid solution outperforms the baselines with an SLA violation rate of only 6%, ensuring stable SLA compliance across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5c06SLA\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u4ece23%\u964d\u81f36%", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684SLA\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1SLA\u5408\u89c4\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u6269\u7f29\u5668\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u6269\u7f29\u5668\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548cSLA\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdb\u884c\u5373\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230Kubernetes\u4e2d", "result": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u7684SLA\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe23%\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u4ec56%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SLA\u5408\u89c4\u6027", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u786e\u4fdd\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u7684SLA\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

In other situations the parallel tasks have constraints that require them to synchronize their start and possibly departure times. This is true of many parallelized machine learning workloads, and the popular Apache Spark processing engine has recently added support for Barrier Execution Mode, which allows users to add such barriers to their jobs. These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.\n  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism. For the purely 1-barrier case we compare the bounds and simulation results to benchmark data from a standalone Spark system. We study the overhead in the real system, and based on its distribution we attribute it to the dual event and polling-driven mechanism used to schedule barrier-mode jobs. We develop a model for this type of overhead and validate it against the real system through simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u5c4f\u969c\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9Apache Spark\u7684\u5c4f\u969c\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5c4f\u969c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c4f\u969c\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982Apache Spark\u7684\u5c4f\u969c\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9\u51fa\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f2\u671f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "1) \u5206\u6790(s,k,l)\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5728k\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210l\u4e2a\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u79bb\u5f00\uff1b2) \u63a8\u5bfc\u6df7\u5408\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6709\u5c4f\u969c\u548c\u65e0\u5c4f\u969c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff1b3) \u9488\u5bf9\u7eaf1-\u5c4f\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acbSpark\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b4) \u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u53cc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6e\u8be2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff1b5) \u4e3a\u6b64\u7c7b\u5f00\u9500\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2) \u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\uff1b3) \u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645Spark\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b4) \u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5c4f\u969c\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5f00\u9500\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u53cc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6e\u8be2\u9a71\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff1b5) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f00\u9500\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c4f\u969c\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u786e\u5b9e\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9\u7a7a\u95f2\u548c\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5c4f\u969c\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

While compact models are the ultimate deployment target, conventional pruning-aware distributed training systems typically fail to reduce communication overhead because unstructured sparsity cannot be efficiently exploited by highly optimized dense collective primitives. We present PruneX, a distributed data-parallel training system that co-designs pruning algorithms with cluster hierarchy to reduce inter-node bandwidth usage. PruneX introduces the Hierarchical Structured ADMM (H-SADMM) algorithm, which enforces node-level structured sparsity before inter-node synchronization, enabling dynamic buffer compaction that eliminates both zero-valued transmissions and indexing overhead. The system adopts a leader-follower execution model with separated intra-node and inter-node process groups, performing dense collectives on compacted tensors over bandwidth-limited links while confining full synchronization to high-bandwidth intra-node interconnects. Evaluation on ResNet architectures across 64 GPUs demonstrates that PruneX reduces inter-node communication volume by approximately 60% and achieves 6.75x strong scaling speedup, outperforming the dense baseline (5.81x) and Top-K gradient compression (3.71x) on the Puhti supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finland).", "AI": {"tldr": "PruneX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u96c6\u7fa4\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u572864\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b06.75\u500d\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u8282\u70b9GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u65e5\u76ca\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u526a\u679d\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u96c6\u4f53\u539f\u8bed\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPruneX\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5316ADMM\uff08H-SADMM\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u524d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u96f6\u503c\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u7d22\u5f15\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u94fe\u8def\u4e0a\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u5f20\u91cf\u6267\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u9650\u5236\u5728\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u4e92\u8fde\u4e0a", "result": "\u5728ResNet\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u768464\u4e2aGPU\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cPruneX\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea660%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b06.75\u500d\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff085.81\u500d\uff09\u548cTop-K\u68af\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\uff083.71\u500d\uff09", "conclusion": "PruneX\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u96c6\u7fa4\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, the corresponding models often operate as black boxes, leading them to unintentionally act unfairly towards different demographic groups. This has led to a growing focus on fairness in AI software recently, alongside the traditional focus on the effectiveness of AI models. Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps. This highlights the need for agreement with relevant stakeholders on well-defined, contextually appropriate fairness definitions, the corresponding evaluation metrics, and formalized processes to better integrate fairness into AI/ML projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc726\u4e2a\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5e38\u88ab\u964d\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI/ML\u548cLLM\u5728\u5404\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0aAI\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e86\u89e3AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea23\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c26\u4e2a\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9AI/ML\u8f6f\u4ef6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f(SDLC)\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\u5230\u65e9\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u9898\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u9879(\u5982\u529f\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u671f\u9650)\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e38\u88ab\u964d\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5c31\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u76f8\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6b63\u5f0f\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6574\u5408\u5230AI/ML\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6b63\u5f0f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u6574\u5408\u5230AI/ML\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0d\u88ab\u5176\u4ed6\u5f00\u53d1\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6240\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002"}}

Traditional event data models, also called case-centric, are unable to cope with the complexity introduced by these more refined relationships. Several models have been made to move from case-centric to Object-Centric Event Data (OCED), trying to retain simplicity as much as possible. Still, these suffer from inherent ambiguities, and lack a comprehensive support of essential dimensions related to time and (dynamic) relations. In this work, we propose to fill this gap by leveraging a well-founded ontology of events and bringing ontological foundations to OCED, with a three-step approach. First, we start from key open issues reported in the literature regarding current OCED metamodels, and witness their ambiguity and expressiveness limitations on illustrative and representative examples proposed therein. Second, we consider the OCED Core Model, currently proposed as the basis for defining a new standard for object-centric event data, and we enhance it by grounding it on a lightweight version of UFO-B called gUFO, a well-known foundational ontology tailored to the representation of objects, events, time, and their (dynamic) relations. This results in a new metamodel, which we call gOCED. The third contribution then shows how gOCED at once covers the features of existing metamodels preserving their simplicity, and extends them with the essential features needed to overcome the ambiguity and expressiveness issues reported in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684gOCED\u5143\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5168\u9762\u652f\u6301", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u6b65\u6cd5\uff1a1)\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709OCED\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2)\u57fa\u4e8egUFO\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u589e\u5f3aOCED\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3)\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684gOCED\u5143\u6a21\u578b", "result": "gOCED\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u529f\u80fd\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u575a\u5b9e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0cgOCED\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5143\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840"}}

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models.

All reasoning is executed directly inside BigQuery using native generative AI functions, eliminating data movement and preserving data governance. On a realistic asset-incident dataset, DAR completes the full analytical task in 16 minutes, compared to 8.5 hours for a professional analyst (approximately 32x times faster), while producing useful pattern-based insights and evidence-grounded recommendations.

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "ContextBranch\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3aLLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f15\u5165\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u3001\u5207\u6362\u7b49\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ba1\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u5e73\u574739%\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6848\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u800c\u4e0d\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u8981\u4e48\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u59cb\u4e22\u5931\u6240\u6709\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContextBranch\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u8bed\uff1acheckpoint\uff08\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff09\u3001branch\uff08\u5206\u652f\uff09\u3001switch\uff08\u5207\u6362\uff09\u548cinject\uff08\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u6355\u83b7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u5728\u9694\u79bb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5408\u5e76\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u572830\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u652f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6539\u8fdb\u5c24\u5176\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5206\u652f\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c1158.1%\uff08\u4ece31.0\u6761\u6d88\u606f\u964d\u81f313.0\u6761\uff09\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u652f\u662fAI\u8f85\u52a9\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u65f6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations. Our results shed light on the value of software development best practices in effective use of agents, suggest the kinds of tasks for which agents may be suitable, and point towards future opportunities for better agentic interfaces and agentic use guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5c06AI\u4ee3\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6001\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u89c2\u5bdf\uff08N=13\uff09\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\uff08N=99\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u91cd\u89c6\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u575a\u6301\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u878d\u5165\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u6301\u79ef\u6781\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76f8\u4fe1\u81ea\u5df1\u80fd\u5f25\u8865\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u5408\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u754c\u9762\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5357\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We argue that current LLMs struggle not only due to data scarcity but, more importantly, because they lack supervision that guides interpretable and effective performance improvements. In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "PerfCoder\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "PerfCoder\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u51fa\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728PIE\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPerfCoder\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cPerfCoder\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5f53\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u5668-\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5927LLM\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c0632B\u6a21\u578b\u548cGPT-5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u610f\u8bc6\u3002PerfCoder\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cLLM\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7801\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance.

To support companies in their transition towards DevOps, this paper presents an adaptation of DevOps according to security regulations and standards. We report on our longitudinal study at Siemens AG, consisting of several individual sub-studies in the inception, validation, and initial adoption of our framework based on RefA as well as the implications for practice. RefA is a prescriptive model of a security compliant DevOps lifecycle based on the IEC 62443-4-1 standard.

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381", "AI": {"tldr": "Teralizer\uff1a\u5c06Java\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Teralizer\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5c06JUnit\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3ajqwik\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1aEvoSuite\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6539\u8fdb\u7a81\u53d8\u5206\u65701-4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u6210\u719f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7f16\u5199\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u6539\u8fdb0.05-0.07\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b632\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9eJava\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u53ea\u67091.7%\u5b8c\u6210\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "Teralizer\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility.

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues.
