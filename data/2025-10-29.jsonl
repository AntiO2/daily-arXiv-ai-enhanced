In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional\nframework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture\nsyntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual\ngraph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and\nlong-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for\nfine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse\nmulti-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive\nexperiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\\% and\n99.2\\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical\ncontributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/ZixianReid/Multigraph_match"}

However, evidence regarding where and when\nthese tools actually enhance productivity is unclear. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how GenAI adoption affects different dimensions of developer\nproductivity. We surveyed 415 software practitioners to capture their\nperceptions of productivity changes associated with AI-assisted development\nusing the SPACE framework - Satisfaction and well-being, Performance, Activity,\nCommunication and collaboration, and Efficiency and flow. Our results,\ndisaggregated by frequency of AI usage, reveal limited overall productivity\nchange, highlighting the productivity paradox in which developers become faster\nbut do not necessarily create better software or feel more fulfilled."}

However, existing benchmarks for code agent evaluation face two major\nlimitations: high annotation cost and expertise requirements, and rigid\nevaluation metrics that rely primarily on unit tests. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that\nleverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging\nproject-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel\nbenchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with\nstructured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive\nevaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data\nsources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an\nAgent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of\nvarious test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents\nand evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation\nand evaluation."}

This surge has exposed a critical\nbottleneck: the lack of scalable, reliable methods to evaluate these outputs.\nHuman evaluation is costly and time-consuming, while traditional automated\nmetrics like BLEU fail to capture nuanced quality aspects. In response, the\nLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm - using LLMs for automated evaluation - has emerged.\nThis approach leverages the advanced reasoning of LLMs, offering a path toward\nhuman-like nuance at automated scale. However, LLM-as-a-Judge research in SE is\nstill in its early stages. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the\ncommunity toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLM-generated software\nartifacts. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies, analyze their\nlimitations, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap. We\nenvision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates\ncapable of consistent, multi-faceted artifact evaluation by 2030. Our work aims\nto foster research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, ultimately\nimproving the scalability of software artifact evaluation."}

While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for\nfunction-level documentation, they fail at the repository level, where\ncapturing architectural patterns and cross-module interactions is essential. We\nintroduce CodeWiki, the first open-source framework for holistic\nrepository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki\nemploys three innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves\narchitectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with dynamic\ndelegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual and visual artifacts including\narchitecture diagrams and data flows. We also present CodeWikiBench, the first\nrepository-level documentation benchmark with multi-level rubrics and agentic\nassessment. CodeWiki achieves 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and\n64.80% with open-source alternatives, outperforming existing closed-source\nsystems and demonstrating scalable, accurate documentation for real-world\nrepositories."}

We invited a crowd of people to discuss what future software\nengineering has. FUSE became a 3-day marathon on whether there is actually a\nfuture at all for SE. This essay is a slightly dark take about what I saw at\nthat event, very loosely based on the discussions that took place, adding some\nhealthy sarcasm and cynicism, the intellectual salt and pepper I never seem to\nrun out of. I listened to the brilliant people who gathered to talk about where\nwe're headed, and distilled three nightmares headed in our direction: software\nmakers who don't know what they're doing, but get the job done anyway, a field\nmoving so fast it can't remember its own lessons, and technologies multiplying\nlike rabbits in Spring. So, let's start. The future, eh? The future of software\nengineering looks like a car crash in slow motion: you can see it coming but\nyou can't look away. The thing is..."}
