In the current era, Transformer-based architectures underpin the majority of state-of-the-art (SOTA) larger models that are also increasingly deployed on customised computing hardware for low-power and real-time applications. However, the fundamentally different parallel computation paradigms between general-purpose and customised computing often lead to compromises in model transfer and deployability, which typically come at the cost of complexity, efficiency or accuracy. Moreover, many cross-platform optimisation principles have also remained underexplored in existing studies. This paper introduces UniFormer, a unified and efficient Transformer architecture for both general-purpose and customised computing platforms. By enabling higher parallelism and compute-storage fusion, UniFormer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and latency on GPUs while exhibiting strong adaptability on FPGAs.

The recent Armv9 architecture introduces Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), enabling tile-based matrix operations with high throughput.

To address this, we propose LOOPS, a hybrid execution framework that combines row-wise CSR-part with vector-wise BCSR-part layout, enabling cooperative utilization of vector instructions (NEON) and Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) resources. LOOPS supports multi-precision SpMM across FP64, FP32, and FP16 via an adaptive two-level parallelization scheme guided by a lightweight performance model. Experimental results on the entire SuiteSparse on an Apple's M4Pro CPU show that LOOPS achieves average speedups of 9.93$\\times$ (FP32)/14.4$\\times$ (FP64) against the CPU baseline TACO and 71.3$\\times$ (FP32)/54.8$\\times$ (FP64) with respect to Armadillo.

It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.\n  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes.

However, the inclusion of extensive contextual information, including system prompts, MCP tool definitions, and context histories, in MCP-enabled LLM interactions, dramatically inflates token usage. Given that LLM providers charge based on tokens, these expanded contexts can quickly escalate monetary costs and increase the computational load on LLM services. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based analysis of MCP-enabled interactions with LLMs, revealing trade-offs between capability, performance, and cost. We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms. These findings provide useful insights for developing more efficient, robust, and cost-effective MCP-enabled workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9MCP\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "MCP\u867d\u7136\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86token\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u6a21\u578b\u548cMCP\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9token\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86MCP\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684MCP\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}
