### [1] [A New Normalization Form for Limited Distinct Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02865)
*Niko S. Snell,Rayen C. Lee*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据库规范化方法LDNF，通过限制属性的可能值数量来解决非限制性不同属性导致的数据异常问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规范化方法未能解决属性值数量不受限制的问题，这些非限制性不同属性可能导致数据异常和查询不准确。

Method: 提出LDNF方法，将非限制性不同属性转换为限制性不同属性，强制属性符合有限数量的值。

Result: LDNF与现有规范化形式结合使用，填补了当前规范化方法的空白。

Conclusion: LDNF是必要的数据库规范化改进，通过正式方法解决了非限制性不同属性带来的问题。

Abstract: In modern databases, the practice of data normalization continues to be
important in improving data integrity, minimizing redundancies, and eliminating
anomalies. However, since its inception and consequent improvements, there have
been no attempts to document a method which constrains the values of attributes
capable of only possessing a limited quantity of values. These non-limited
distinct attributes pose a problem throughout many relational databases as they
have the potential to cause data anomalies and query inaccuracies. Thus, a new
database normalization method, Limited Distinct Normal Form (LDNF), is
necessary in order to improve upon the currently established data normalization
process. In brief, LDNF is a method which turns non-limited distinct attributes
into limited distinct attributes by forcing the attributes to conform to a
limited quantity of values. Utilizing LDNF in tandem with existing normal forms
fulfills a need in normalization that is otherwise not present when only using
current methods. A formal approach to LDNF is therefore proposed.

TL;DR: Code World Model (CWM)是一个320亿参数的开源LLM，通过Python解释器和Docker环境中的观察-行动轨迹进行训练，在代码生成、数学推理和多轮软件工程任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升代码理解能力，超越仅从静态代码训练所能学到的内容，探索世界模型如何通过推理和规划改进代码生成。

Method: 在Python解释器和Docker环境中进行大量观察-行动轨迹的中期训练，并在可验证的编码、数学和多轮软件工程环境中进行多任务推理强化学习。

Result: CWM在多项基准测试中表现优异：SWE-bench Verified 65.8%、LiveCodeBench 68.6%、Math-500 96.6%、AIME 2024 76.0%。

Conclusion: CWM为研究代码世界建模提供了强大平台，展示了世界模型如何通过逐步模拟Python代码执行来增强智能编码能力。

Abstract: We release Code World Model (CWM), a 32-billion-parameter open-weights LLM,
to advance research on code generation with world models. To improve code
understanding beyond what can be learned from training on static code alone, we
mid-train CWM on a large amount of observation-action trajectories from Python
interpreter and agentic Docker environments, and perform extensive multi-task
reasoning RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering
environments. With CWM, we provide a strong testbed for researchers to explore
the opportunities world modeling affords for improving code generation with
reasoning and planning in computational environments. We present first steps of
how world models can benefit agentic coding, enable step-by-step simulation of
Python code execution, and show early results of how reasoning can benefit from
the latter. CWM is a dense, decoder-only LLM trained with a context size of up
to 131k tokens. Independent of its world modeling capabilities, CWM offers
strong performance on general coding and math tasks: it reaches pass@1 scores
of 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (with test-time scaling), 68.6% on
LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024. To support further
research on code world modeling, we release model checkpoints after
mid-training, SFT, and RL.

### [3] [From Trace to Line: LLM Agent for Real-World OSS Vulnerability Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02389)
*Haoran Xi,Minghao Shao,Brendan Dolan-Gavitt,Muhammad Shafique,Ramesh Karri*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: T2L-Agent是一个项目级的端到端框架，通过从模块到具体漏洞行的渐进式分析，结合运行时证据和AST代码分块，实现精确的漏洞定位和修复指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞检测方法存在代码孤立分析、长上下文处理困难、粗粒度检测等问题，无法为工程师提供精确的行级定位和针对性修复指导。

Method: T2L-Agent采用多轮反馈机制和Agentic Trace Analyzer，融合崩溃点、堆栈跟踪和覆盖率差异等运行时证据，结合AST代码分块进行迭代优化。

Result: 在T2L-ARVO基准测试中，T2L-Agent实现了58.0%的检测率和54.8%的行级定位率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准测试将基于LLM的漏洞检测从粗粒度识别推向可部署、鲁棒、精确的诊断，减少噪音并加速开源软件工作流中的修复过程。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet
prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and
focus on coarse function- or file-level detections - offering limited
actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and
targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent
(Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own
analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable
lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer
(ATA) that fuses runtime evidence - crash points, stack traces, and coverage
deltas - with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond
single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level
diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce
T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash
families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support
both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous
evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On
T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level
localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework
and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification
toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and
accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.

### [4] [AP2O: Correcting LLM-Generated Code Errors Type by Type Like Humans via Adaptive Progressive Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02393)
*Jianqing Zhang,Wei Xia,Hande Dong,Qiang Lin,Jian Cao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出AP2O-Coder方法，通过构建错误笔记本来渐进式优化LLM的代码生成能力，减少编译和运行时错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线偏好优化方法主要关注通过成功/失败信号提升LLM编码能力，但忽视了失败代码中的深层错误类型

Method: 构建错误笔记本，渐进式按错误类型优化LLM，并在训练过程中自适应重放错误类型以适应LLM变化中的弱点

Result: 在0.5B到34B参数的代码和通用LLM上，AP2O-Coder将代码生成性能提升高达3%的pass@k，同时使用更少的偏好数据

Conclusion: AP2O-Coder通过自适应渐进式偏好优化有效提升了LLM的代码生成质量

Abstract: LLMs' code generation capabilities have yielded substantial improvements in
the effectiveness of programming tasks. However, LLM-generated code still
suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference
optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using
pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error
types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive
Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that
guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code
generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and
progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we
adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses
throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and
general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from
0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in
pass@k while using less preference data. Code: https://github.com/TsingZ0/AP2O

### [5] [Dynamic Function Configuration and its Management in Serverless Computing: A Taxonomy and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02404)
*Siddharth Agarwal,Maria A. Rodriguez,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文分析了FaaS环境中资源配置技术，提出了影响函数设计、配置、运行成本和性能保证的因素分类法，并对现有资源配置文献进行了全面综述，指出了研究空白和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器计算模型中，资源配置影响运营成本和性能质量，但平台缺乏透明度使开发者难以优化资源配置，开源框架的独立资源配置增加了复杂性。

Method: 提出资源配置因素分类法，分析现有文献，进行资源配置研究的全面综述。

Result: 识别了函数配置的关键影响因素，系统梳理了当前研究成果，揭示了资源配置优化的挑战和机遇。

Conclusion: 资源配置优化是推动无服务器计算更广泛采用的关键，需要进一步研究来增强函数配置能力和无服务器计算环境的功能。

Abstract: The serverless cloud computing model offers a framework where the service
provider abstracts the underlying infrastructure management from developers. In
this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented
computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that
eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions,
and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with
minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource
allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality
of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces
developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to
request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a
non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while
commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth
proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration
of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming
to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to
resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less
execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource
configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors
that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance
guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource
configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function
configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future
research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the
capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader
adoption.

### [6] [Product Manager Practices for Delegating Work to Generative AI: "Accountability must not be delegated to non-human actors"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02504)
*Mara Ulloa,Jenna L. Butler,Sankeerti Haniyur,Courtney Miller,Barrett Amos,Advait Sarkar,Margaret-Anne Storey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究微软产品经理对生成式AI的采用情况、使用案例、感知收益与障碍，以及他们如何评估任务委托给AI的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI正在改变知识工作的性质，特别是软件开发团队中的产品经理工作。现有研究主要关注开发者与GenAI的互动，对产品经理工作如何因GenAI而演变的理解较少。

Method: 在微软进行混合方法研究：调查885名产品经理，分析731名产品经理的遥测数据，并对15名产品经理进行访谈。

Result: 揭示了产品经理当前的GenAI采用率、使用案例、感知收益与障碍；提出了产品经理评估哪些任务委托给GenAI的框架；描述了产品经理整合GenAI到其角色的适应实践。

Conclusion: 讨论了GenAI工作流程采用过程和软件开发角色的更广泛影响。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is changing the nature of knowledge work, particularly
for Product Managers (PMs) in software development teams. While much software
engineering research has focused on developers' interactions with GenAI, there
is less understanding of how the work of PMs is evolving due to GenAI. To
address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study at Microsoft, a large,
multinational software company: surveying 885 PMs, analyzing telemetry data for
a subset of PMs (N=731), and interviewing a subset of 15 PMs. We contribute:
(1) PMs' current GenAI adoption rates, uses cases, and perceived benefits and
barriers and; (2) a framework capturing how PMs assess which tasks to delegate
to GenAI; (3) PMs adaptation practices for integrating GenAI into their roles
and perceptions of how their role is evolving. We end by discussing
implications on the broader GenAI workflow adoption process and software
development roles.

### [7] [ZeroFalse: Improving Precision in Static Analysis with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02534)
*Mohsen Iranmanesh,Sina Moradi Sabet,Sina Marefat,Ali Javidi Ghasr,Allison Wilson,Iman Sharafaldin,Mohammad A. Tayebi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ZeroFalse框架结合静态分析与LLM，通过结构化分析输出、流敏感追踪和CWE知识，显著减少SAST工具误报，在多个基准测试中达到90%以上的精确率和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAST工具因高误报率削弱开发者信任且需要昂贵的人工排查，需要一种能保持覆盖范围同时减少误报的解决方案。

Method: 将静态分析器输出视为结构化合约，通过流敏感追踪、上下文证据和CWE特定知识进行丰富，然后由LLM进行裁决。

Result: 在OWASP Java基准测试中F1分数达0.912，OpenVuln数据集达0.955，召回率和精确率均超过90%。CWE专用提示优于通用提示，推理导向LLM提供最佳精度-召回平衡。

Conclusion: ZeroFalse是增强SAST可靠性并支持其集成到真实CI/CD流水线的实用且可扩展方法。

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern
software development, yet their adoption is undermined by excessive false
positives that weaken developer trust and demand costly manual triage. We
present ZeroFalse, a framework that integrates static analysis with large
language models (LLMs) to reduce false positives while preserving coverage.
ZeroFalse treats static analyzer outputs as structured contracts, enriching
them with flow-sensitive traces, contextual evidence, and CWE-specific
knowledge before adjudication by an LLM. This design preserves the systematic
reach of static analysis while leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
We evaluate ZeroFalse across both benchmarks and real-world projects using ten
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our best-performing models achieve F1-scores of 0.912 on
the OWASP Java Benchmark and 0.955 on the OpenVuln dataset, maintaining recall
and precision above 90%. Results further show that CWE-specialized prompting
consistently outperforms generic prompts, and reasoning-oriented LLMs provide
the most reliable precision-recall balance. These findings position ZeroFalse
as a practical and scalable approach for enhancing the reliability of SAST and
supporting its integration into real-world CI/CD pipelines.

### [8] [Key Considerations for Auto-Scaling: Lessons from Benchmark Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02585)
*Majid Dashtbani,Ladan Tahvildari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过分析微服务基准测试，识别了影响自动扩展效果的关键生命周期因素，包括架构、实现和部署阶段的问题，并验证了解决这些问题能显著提升自动扩展性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微服务基准测试往往忽视架构设计、实现和部署等基础因素，导致难以在真实条件下评估自动扩展方法的效果。

Method: 将多种先进的自动扩展方法应用于广泛使用的微服务基准测试，识别关键问题并按软件生命周期分类：架构、实现和部署阶段。使用Sock-Shop基准验证这些考虑因素。

Result: 忽视关键生命周期问题会降低自动扩展器性能，而解决这些问题能实现更稳定和高效的扩展。

Conclusion: 生命周期感知的工程实践对于充分发挥微服务系统中自动扩展的潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Microservices have become the dominant architectural paradigm for building
scalable and modular cloud-native systems. However, achieving effective
auto-scaling in such systems remains a non-trivial challenge, as it depends not
only on advanced scaling techniques but also on sound design, implementation,
and deployment practices. Yet, these foundational aspects are often overlooked
in existing benchmarks, making it difficult to evaluate autoscaling methods
under realistic conditions. In this paper, we identify a set of practical
auto-scaling considerations by applying several state-of-the-art autoscaling
methods to widely used microservice benchmarks. To structure these findings, we
classify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle:
Architecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers
high-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service
dependencies. The Implementation phase includes aspects like initialization
overhead, metrics instrumentation, and error propagation. The Deployment phase
focuses on runtime configurations such as resource limits and health checks. We
validate these considerations using the Sock-Shop benchmark and evaluate
diverse auto-scaling strategies, including threshold-based, control-theoretic,
learning-based, black-box optimization, and dependency-aware approaches. Our
findings show that overlooking key lifecycle concerns can degrade autoscaler
performance, while addressing them leads to more stable and efficient scaling.
These results underscore the importance of lifecycle-aware engineering for
unlocking the full potential of auto-scaling in microservice-based systems.

### [9] [RedCodeAgent: Automatic Red-teaming Agent against Diverse Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02609)
*Chengquan Guo,Chulin Xie,Yu Yang,Zhaorun Chen,Zinan Lin,Xander Davies,Yarin Gal,Dawn Song,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了RedCodeAgent，首个自动化红队代理，用于系统性地发现各种代码代理中的漏洞。通过自适应内存模块和定制工具箱，能动态选择最有效的红队工具组合，识别传统方法可能忽略的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理虽然增强了代码生成能力，但也引入了严重的安全风险。现有的静态安全基准和红队工具无法覆盖某些边界条件（如不同越狱工具的组合效应），无法识别新兴的现实世界风险场景。

Method: 开发了RedCodeAgent，包含自适应内存模块来利用现有越狱知识，动态选择最有效的红队工具和工具组合。建立了模拟沙箱环境来评估代码代理的执行结果，减少仅依赖静态代码的LLM评估器可能存在的偏见。

Result: 在多个最先进代码代理、多样化风险场景和各种编程语言的广泛评估中，RedCodeAgent始终优于现有红队方法，实现了更高的攻击成功率、更低的拒绝率和高效率。在真实世界代码助手（如Cursor和Codeium）上验证，暴露了先前未识别的安全风险。

Conclusion: 通过自动化和优化红队流程，RedCodeAgent实现了对代码代理的可扩展、自适应和有效的安全评估。

Abstract: Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code
generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling
dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While
these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also
introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks
and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky
scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the
combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose
RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically
uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module,
RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the
most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox
for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise
be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox
environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents,
mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code.
Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents,
diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent
consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack
success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further
validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium,
exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing
red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective
safety assessments of code agents.

### [10] [Automatic Building Code Review: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02634)
*Hanlong Wan,Weili Xu,Michael Rosenberg,Jian Zhang,Aysha Siddika*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BIM和LLM的自动化建筑规范审查框架，通过智能代理从异构文件中提取几何和系统属性，并利用COMcheck API和RAG推理进行规范验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限或农村地区建筑官员面临的手工设计文档审查劳动密集、易出错且成本高的问题，利用BIM和LLM技术实现自动化规范审查。

Method: 开发智能代理驱动框架，整合BIM数据提取与自动化验证，采用RAG和MCP代理管道，通过COMcheck API进行确定性验证，RAG进行灵活规则解释。

Result: 案例演示显示框架能自动提取几何属性、解析运行计划、验证照明规范，GPT-4o表现最佳，MCP代理管道在严谨性和可靠性上优于RAG推理管道。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了自动化规范审查，展示了可扩展、可互操作且生产就绪的方法，将BIM与权威规范审查工具相结合。

Abstract: Building officials, particularly those in resource-constrained or rural
jurisdictions, face labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly manual reviews of
design documents as projects increase in size and complexity. The growing
adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents opportunities for automated code review (ACR) solutions. This
study introduces a novel agent-driven framework that integrates BIM-based data
extraction with automated verification using both retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. The
framework employs LLM-enabled agents to extract geometry, schedules, and system
attributes from heterogeneous file types, which are then processed for building
code checking through two complementary mechanisms: (1) direct API calls to the
US Department of Energy COMcheck engine, providing deterministic and
audit-ready outputs, and (2) RAG-based reasoning over rule provisions, enabling
flexible interpretation where coverage is incomplete or ambiguous.
  The framework was evaluated through case demonstrations, including automated
extraction of geometric attributes (such as surface area, tilt, and insulation
values), parsing of operational schedules, and validation of lighting
allowances under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022. Comparative performance tests
across multiple LLMs showed that GPT-4o achieved the best balance of efficiency
and stability, while smaller models exhibited inconsistencies or failures.
Results confirm that MCP agent pipelines outperform RAG reasoning pipelines in
rigor and reliability. This work advances ACR research by demonstrating a
scalable, interoperable, and production-ready approach that bridges BIM with
authoritative code review tools.

### [11] [Using Fourier Analysis and Mutant Clustering to Accelerate DNN Mutation Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02718)
*Ali Ghanbari,Sasan Tavakkol*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DM#是一种基于傅里叶分析的深度神经网络突变测试加速技术，通过量化突变体行为进行聚类，选择代表性突变体进行测试，从而显著减少测试成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络突变分析成本高昂，因为需要在大型数据集上测试大量生成的突变体。

Method: 利用傅里叶分析量化突变体行为，将行为相似的突变体聚类，从每个簇中选择代表性突变体进行测试，并将测试结果复用于同一簇中的其他突变体。

Result: 在14个不同规模的DNN模型上评估，DM#平均加速突变测试28.38%，平均突变分数误差仅为0.72%，相比其他基线技术误差显著降低。

Conclusion: DM#能有效加速DNN突变测试，在保持高准确性的同时大幅减少计算成本。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) mutation analysis is a promising approach to
evaluating test set adequacy. Due to the large number of generated mutants that
must be tested on large datasets, mutation analysis is costly. In this paper,
we present a technique, named DM#, for accelerating DNN mutation testing using
Fourier analysis. The key insight is that DNN outputs are real-valued functions
suitable for Fourier analysis that can be leveraged to quantify mutant behavior
using only a few data points. DM# uses the quantified mutant behavior to
cluster the mutants so that the ones with similar behavior fall into the same
group. A representative from each group is then selected for testing, and the
result of the test, e.g., whether the mutant is killed or survived, is reused
for all other mutants represented by the selected mutant, obviating the need
for testing other mutants. 14 DNN models of sizes ranging from thousands to
millions of parameters, trained on different datasets, are used to evaluate DM#
and compare it to several baseline techniques. Our results provide empirical
evidence on the effectiveness of DM# in accelerating mutation testing by
28.38%, on average, at the average cost of only 0.72% error in mutation score.
Moreover, on average, DM# incurs 11.78, 15.16, and 114.36 times less mutation
score error compared to random mutant selection, boundary sample selection, and
random sample selection techniques, respectively, while generally offering
comparable speed-up.

*Tamjid Al Rahat,Yanju Chen,Yu Feng,Yuan Tian*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AuthFix是一个基于LLM的OpenID Connect漏洞自动修复系统，通过故障定位、补丁合成和验证三个组件，成功修复了74%的OpenID漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OpenID Connect虽然广泛采用，但存在严重安全漏洞导致重大经济损失，需要自动化修复方案来应对领域特定的复杂性和精确的故障定位需求。

Method: AuthFix采用反例引导的修复引擎，集成故障定位、补丁合成和补丁验证三个关键组件，使用新颖的Petri网模型检查器来确保补丁正确性。

Result: 在23个OpenID漏洞的数据集上，AuthFix成功生成了17个正确补丁（74%），其中大部分补丁与开发者编写的修复在语义上等效。

Conclusion: AuthFix证明了基于LLM的自动化修复方法在OpenID Connect安全漏洞修复中的有效性，能够生成高质量的语义等效补丁。

Abstract: OpenID Connect has revolutionized online authentication based on single
sign-on (SSO) by providing a secure and convenient method for accessing
multiple services with a single set of credentials. Despite its widespread
adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant
financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust
mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution
for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However,
challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise
fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose
AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated
OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization,
patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based
model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively
modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates
that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs
(74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to
developer-written fixes.

TL;DR: C2|Q>是一个硬件无关的量子软件开发框架，通过将经典代码规范转换为量子可执行程序，使经典软件工程师能够更容易地使用量子计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子开发环境要求开发者处理软件栈中的底层细节，使得经典软件工程师难以使用。C2|Q>旨在弥合这一差距，让更广泛的开发者社区能够使用量子计算。

Method: 采用模块化软件工程原则，将工作流分为三个核心模块：编码器（分类问题、生成量子兼容格式、构建量子电路）、部署模块（生成电路并基于保真度、运行时间和成本推荐硬件）、解码器（将量子输出解释为经典解决方案）。

Result: 编码器模块完成率达到93.8%，硬件推荐模块为扩展到56量子位的工作负载持续选择适当的量子设备，完整C2|Q>工作流成功处理了434个Python代码片段和100个JSON输入，完成率分别为93.8%和100%。在NISQ硬件上的案例研究中，相比使用低级量子SDK的手动实现，C2|Q>减少了近40倍的实施工作量。

Conclusion: C2|Q>框架成功地将经典软件规范转换为量子可执行程序，显著降低了量子软件开发的复杂性，使经典软件工程师能够更容易地使用量子计算技术。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging as a critical discipline to
make quantum computing accessible to a broader developer community; however,
most quantum development environments still require developers to engage with
low-level details across the software stack - including problem encoding,
circuit construction, algorithm configuration, hardware selection, and result
interpretation - making them difficult for classical software engineers to use.
To bridge this gap, we present C2|Q>: a hardware-agnostic quantum software
development framework that translates classical specifications (code) into
quantum-executable programs while preserving methodological rigor. The
framework applies modular software engineering principles by classifying the
workflow into three core modules: an encoder that classifies problems, produces
Quantum-Compatible Formats (QCFs), and constructs quantum circuits, a
deployment module that generates circuits and recommends hardware based on
fidelity, runtime, and cost, and a decoder that interprets quantum outputs into
classical solutions. In evaluation, the encoder module achieved a 93.8%
completion rate, the hardware recommendation module consistently selected the
appropriate quantum devices for workloads scaling up to 56 qubits, and the full
C2|Q>: workflow successfully processed classical specifications (434 Python
snippets and 100 JSON inputs) with completion rates of 93.8% and 100%,
respectively. For case study problems executed on publicly available NISQ
hardware, C2|Q>: reduced the required implementation effort by nearly 40X
compared to manual implementations using low-level quantum software development
kits (SDKs), with empirical runs limited to small- and medium-sized instances
consistent with current NISQ capabilities. The open-source implementation of

TL;DR: 论文提出一个猜想：代码表示越容易解析，模型性能越好。通过GramTrans方法将上下文无关语言转换为LL(1)类表示，实验证明解析难度与模型性能强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用多种代码表示（纯文本、语法规则序列、语法树序列），但缺乏对解析难度与模型效果关系的系统理解。

Method: 提出GramTrans方法，使用分层冲突消除算法将上下文无关语言转换为LL(1)类表示，在解析简单性和标记效率之间实现灵活权衡。

Result: 在Python和Java上使用三个代码生成模型进行测试，GramTrans在多个基准测试中相比基线表示都带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 解析难度与模型性能存在强相关性，支持了论文的猜想，GramTrans方法能有效提升代码生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Code generation has shown great promise in assisting software development. A
fundamental yet underexplored question is how the choice of code representation
affects model performance. While existing studies employ various
representations, such as treating code as plain text, grammar rule sequences,
or syntax tree sequences, they lack a principled understanding of the
relationship between parsing difficulty and model effectiveness. This paper
proposes a conjecture: the easier a representation is to parse, the better
performance the model achieves. We formalize this idea using grammar classes,
where representations in simpler classes (e.g., LL(1)) are easier to parse.
Through a controlled experiment on a Python-based DSL, we show that parsing
difficulty strongly correlates with model performance. Motivated by this
finding, we present GramTrans, a general approach that automatically transforms
a context-free language into a representation within the LL(1) class. GramTrans
introduces a novel hierarchical conflict elimination algorithm, enabling a
flexible trade-off between syntactic simplicity and token efficiency. We
evaluate GramTrans on both Python and Java using three code generation models:
StarCoder 1B, DeepSeek-Coder 1.3B, and Qwen2.5 1.5B. Across multiple
benchmarks, GramTrans consistently delivers significant improvements over
baseline representations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing representations
reconfirms the strong alignment between parsing difficulty and model
performance, providing additional support for the conjecture.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 通过稀疏自编码器分解LLM表示，识别代码正确性方向，发现这些方向能可靠预测错误代码，且基础模型中学习到的代码正确性机制在指令调优后仍保持有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在软件开发中日益重要，大量AI建议代码进入生产环境，理解其内部正确性机制对于安全部署至关重要。

Method: 应用稀疏自编码器分解LLM表示，使用t统计量选择预测方向，通过分离分数从基础模型表示中确定引导方向，并通过引导、注意力分析和权重正交化分析其机制特性。

Result: 代码正确性方向能可靠预测错误代码，纠正能力虽然统计显著但涉及修复错误与保留正确代码之间的权衡。成功的代码生成依赖于关注测试用例而非问题描述。

Conclusion: 基础模型中识别的方向在指令调优后仍保持有效性，表明预训练期间学习的代码正确性机制在微调过程中被重新利用。提出了三个实际应用：提示策略应优先考虑测试示例、预测方向可作为错误警报、预测器可指导选择性引导。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become integral to software development, with
substantial portions of AI-suggested code entering production, understanding
their internal correctness mechanisms becomes critical for safe deployment. We
apply sparse autoencoders to decompose LLM representations, identifying
directions that correspond to code correctness. We select predictor directions
using t-statistics and steering directions through separation scores from base
model representations, then analyze their mechanistic properties through
steering, attention analysis, and weight orthogonalization. We find that code
correctness directions in LLMs reliably predict incorrect code, while
correction capabilities, though statistically significant, involve tradeoffs
between fixing errors and preserving correct code. Mechanistically, successful
code generation depends on attending to test cases rather than problem
descriptions. Moreover, directions identified in base models retain their
effectiveness after instruction-tuning, suggesting code correctness mechanisms
learned during pre-training are repurposed during fine-tuning. Our mechanistic
insights suggest three practical applications: prompting strategies should
prioritize test examples over elaborate problem descriptions, predictor
directions can serve as error alarms for developer review, and these same
predictors can guide selective steering, intervening only when errors are
anticipated to prevent the code corruption from constant steering.

TL;DR: AUTOPROBE是一种模型无关的方法，通过动态选择LLM内部最有信息量的表示来评估代码正确性，在编译性、功能性和安全性评估方面均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预选层和token位置的表示，限制了在不同模型架构和任务间的泛化能力，需要一种更通用的代码正确性评估方法。

Method: 使用基于注意力的机制学习隐藏状态的重要性分数，聚焦最相关特征，然后聚合加权表示并通过探测分类器预测代码正确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和代码LLM上的实验显示，AUTOPROBE持续优于基线方法，安全性评估比最先进白盒方法高18%，编译性和功能性评估分别比其他方法高19%和111%。

Conclusion: 动态选择重要内部信号使AUTOPROBE成为评估各种LLM生成代码正确性的稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation and are increasingly integrated into the software development
process. However, ensuring the correctness of LLM-generated code remains a
critical concern. Prior work has shown that the internal representations of
LLMs encode meaningful signals for assessing code correctness. Nevertheless,
the existing methods rely on representations from pre-selected/fixed layers and
token positions, which could limit its generalizability across diverse model
architectures and tasks. In this work, we introduce AUTOPROBE, a novel
model-agnostic approach that dynamically selects the most informative internal
representations for code correctness assessment. AUTOPROBE employs an
attention-based mechanism to learn importance scores for hidden states,
enabling it to focus on the most relevant features. These weighted
representations are then aggregated and passed to a probing classifier to
predict code correctness across multiple dimensions, including compilability,
functionality, and security. To evaluate the performance of AUTOPROBE, we
conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and code LLMs. Our
experimental results show that AUTOPROBE consistently outperforms the
baselines. For security assessment, AUTOPROBE surpasses the state-of-the-art
white-box approach by 18%. For compilability and functionality assessment,
AUTOPROBE demonstrates its highest robustness to code complexity, with the
performance higher than the other approaches by up to 19% and 111%,
respectively. These findings highlight that dynamically selecting important
internal signals enables AUTOPROBE to serve as a robust and generalizable
solution for assessing the correctness of code generated by various LLMs.

Motivation: 随着软件架构日益分布式和易变，诊断系统问题变得更加困难，需要处理碎片化的可观测性和更复杂的根因分析。

Method: 基于行业实践和可观测性框架，提出了三种设计模式：分布式追踪用于跨服务请求流可视化，应用指标用于结构化性能监控，基础设施指标用于环境监控。

Result: 这些模式提供了监控云原生应用的实用指导，帮助改善延迟分析、根因检测、实时监控和资源利用评估。

Conclusion: 三种设计模式为软件从业者提供了应对云原生应用可观测性挑战的有效指导，有助于提升系统可靠性和可维护性。

Abstract: Observability helps ensure the reliability and maintainability of
cloud-native applications. As software architectures become increasingly
distributed and subject to change, it becomes a greater challenge to diagnose
system issues effectively, often having to deal with fragmented observability
and more difficult root cause analysis. This paper builds upon our previous
work and introduces three design patterns that address key challenges in
monitoring cloud-native applications. Distributed Tracing improves visibility
into request flows across services, aiding in latency analysis and root cause
detection, Application Metrics provides a structured approach to instrumenting
applications with meaningful performance indicators, enabling real-time
monitoring and anomaly detection, and Infrastructure Metrics focuses on
monitoring the environment in which the system is operated, helping teams
assess resource utilization, scalability, and operational health. These
patterns are derived from industry practices and observability frameworks and
aim to offer guidance for software practitioners.

Motivation: 现有文献关于如何在课堂上应用ASD缺乏可操作的建议，往往过于关注框架或偏离软件开发本身。

Method: 基于高等教育环境中的教学经验，开发了一个模式语言，包含五个具体模式：限制团队规模、缩小项目范围、非关键业务项目、自组织团队和团队选择主题。

Result: 提出了五个针对团队和项目设置阶段的模式，作为开发完整模式语言的起点。

Conclusion: 这些模式为高等教育中教授ASD实践提供了实用的指导，特别关注团队组建和项目设置的初始阶段。

Abstract: Higher education courses teaching about agile software development (ASD) have
increased in commonality as the ideas behind the Agile Manifesto became more
commonplace in the industry. However, a lot of the literature on how ASD is
applied in the classroom does not provide much actionable advice, focusing on
frameworks or even moving beyond the software development area into teaching in
an agile way. We, therefore, showcase early work on a pattern language that
focuses on teaching ASD practices to university students, which stems from our
own experiences as educators in higher education contexts. We present five
patterns, specifically focused on team and project setup phase: Capping Team
Size, Smaller Project Scope, Business Non-Critical Project, Self-assembling
Teams, and Team Chooses Topic as a starting point for developing the overall
pattern language.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于场景的方法来评估LLM生成代码的质量，通过测量代码异味并与专业编写的参考解决方案进行比较，发现在代码质量方面LLM生成的代码明显差于人类编写的代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有大量研究关注LLM生成代码的功能正确性，但关于代码质量的研究相对较少。本研究旨在评估LLM生成代码的质量，识别最需要改进的场景。

Method: 采用基于场景的方法，测量代码异味作为代码质量指标，并与专业编写的参考解决方案进行对比。将测试数据集按代码主题和任务复杂度划分为不同子集，使用自动化测试系统对四个先进LLM（Gemini Pro、ChatGPT、Codex、Falcon）生成的Java程序进行实验。

Result: LLM生成的代码比参考解决方案具有更高的代码异味发生率。Falcon表现最好（异味增加42.28%），其次是Gemini Pro（62.07%）、ChatGPT（65.05%）和Codex（84.97%）。所有LLM的平均异味增加为63.34%，其中实现异味增加73.35%，设计异味增加21.42%。更复杂的编码任务和涉及面向对象概念等高级主题的代码异味增加更大。

Conclusion: 在代码异味方面，LLM在各种编码任务复杂度和主题上的表现与相应场景下人类编写代码的质量高度相关，但LLM生成代码的质量明显差于人类编写的代码。

Abstract: Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate
program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of
generated code, but there is far less on code quality.
  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating
the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which
the quality of LLM generated code should be improved.
  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code
quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of
professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets
according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to
represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also
present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with
the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four
state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.
  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code
smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with
a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)
and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was
63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design
smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more
complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving
object-orientated concepts.
  Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding
task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human
written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM
generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.

Motivation: 随着组织从单体系统向微服务迁移，现有方法主要关注架构层面的指导，而忽视了代码层面的挑战和依赖关系，导致迁移过程仍然需要大量手动工作。

Method: 开发了一个包含七种重构方法的目录，这些方法整合了文献中已识别的重构技术，并提供了结构化的逐步指导来处理代码层面的依赖关系。

Result: 该目录为开发者提供了系统化的迁移指南，简化了迁移过程，并为潜在的自动化奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了在代码层面系统化微服务迁移过程的空白，使开发者能够更高效地实施这些变更。

Abstract: As organizations increasingly transition from monolithic systems to
microservices, they aim to achieve higher availability, automatic scaling,
simplified infrastructure management, enhanced collaboration, and streamlined
deployments. However, this migration process remains largely manual and
labour-intensive. While existing literature offers various strategies for
decomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level
guidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that
developers must address during the migration. This article introduces a
catalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition
to a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The
catalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates
refactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in
systematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured,
step-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the
groundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement
these changes efficiently and effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的测试预言质量评估指标——状态字段覆盖率，该指标通过静态分析测量测试预言在测试执行期间可能访问的对象状态字段比例，能够有效指导测试预言改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试预言质量评估指标要么无法全面指导预言改进，要么局限于特定类型的预言，缺乏通用性。需要一种能全面评估预言质量并指导改进的通用指标。

Method: 引入状态字段覆盖率指标，通过静态分析计算测试预言在测试执行期间可能访问的对象状态字段比例。实现了一个静态计算该指标的机制。

Result: 在涉及273个表示不变式和249,027个测试断言的实验中，状态字段覆盖率与预言故障检测能力（通过变异得分衡量）呈强相关性。

Conclusion: 状态字段覆盖率是评估测试预言质量的合适指标，能够有效指导测试预言改进，提高测试过程的整体有效性。

Abstract: The effectiveness of testing in uncovering software defects depends not only
on the characteristics of the test inputs and how thoroughly they exercise the
software, but also on the quality of the oracles used to determine whether the
software behaves as expected. Therefore, assessing the quality of oracles is
crucial to improve the overall effectiveness of the testing process. Existing
metrics have been used for this purpose, but they either fail to provide a
comprehensive basis for guiding oracle improvement, or they are tailored to
specific types of oracles, thus limiting their generality.
  In this paper, we introduce state field coverage, a novel metric for
assessing oracle quality. This metric measures the proportion of an object's
state, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access
during test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a
higher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software
under analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to
determine whether tests pass or not.
  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage
metric. Being statically computed, the metric is efficient and provides direct
guidance for improving test oracles by identifying state fields that remain
unexamined. We evaluate state field coverage through experiments involving 273
representation invariants and 249,027 test assertions. The results show that
state field coverage is a well-suited metric for assessing oracle quality, as
it strongly correlates with the oracles' fault-detection ability, measured by
mutation score.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现LLMs在代码任务中过度依赖命名模式而非真正的语义理解，通过引入语义保持的混淆技术创建了ClassEval-Obf基准来更可靠地评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs如何理解代码含义，区分代码通过结构语义和人类可解释命名两个通道传达信息，当前基准可能奖励命名模式记忆而非真正语义推理。

Method: 引入语义保持的混淆技术，创建ClassEval-Obf基准，系统性地抑制命名线索同时保持代码行为不变。

Result: 去除命名通道严重损害意图级任务性能，在执行任务中也观察到一致性能下降，混淆技术暴露了标识符泄露问题。

Conclusion: ClassEval-Obf基准减少了性能膨胀差距，削弱了记忆捷径，为评估LLMs代码理解和泛化能力提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how
they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates
through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and
human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel
severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models
regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent
reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing
that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than
genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite
of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier
leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we
release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically
suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that
ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization
shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code
understanding and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了两种LLM策略来减少自动化程序修复中的噪音：bug abstention（排除系统难以修复的bug）和patch validation（拒绝不太可能是好修复的补丁），在Google代码库的bug集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代理式自动化程序修复系统在处理复杂仓库级bug时产生的噪音问题，避免向开发者展示不太可能的补丁，节省开发者时间并增强对自动化代码更改的信任。

Method: 引入两种互补的LLM策略：bug abstention策略排除系统不太可能修复的bug，patch validation策略拒绝不太可能是好修复的补丁。在Google代码库的三个bug集上评估这些策略。

Result: 在174个人工报告的bug集上，通过两种策略移除被拒绝的bug和补丁轨迹，可将成功率分别提高13和15个百分点，组合使用时提高39个百分点。在空指针异常和清理器报告的bug上，补丁验证也提高了平均单样本成功率。

Conclusion: 这种双策略方法为代理式APR系统的可靠、工业规模部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex,
repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still
need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address
the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise,
wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We
introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug
abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the
agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that
are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on
three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches
generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported
bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise
success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points,
respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer
exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports,
patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This
two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale
deployment of agentic APR systems.

TL;DR: ElasticMoE是一个用于MoE大语言模型的弹性扩展框架，通过解耦推理执行和内存操作，实现细粒度、低延迟、零停机的扩展能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型扩展策略存在粒度粗、延迟长、成本高的问题，无法适应云部署中突发、短期的流量模式。

Method: 采用HBM管理模块重用权重和KV缓存，通过零拷贝重映射和点对点传输；基于虚拟内存的专家重分配机制迁移MoE专家，避免昂贵的缓冲区重新分配。

Result: 在Ascend NPU上的评估显示，ElasticMoE实现了高达9倍的扩展延迟降低、2倍的吞吐量提升，并显著改善了SLO达成率。

Conclusion: ElasticMoE通过实现细粒度、并发的扩展，最小化服务中断，提升了在动态云环境中部署大规模MoE LLM的实用性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models promise efficient scaling of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of experts per token, but their
parallelized inference pipelines make elastic serving challenging. Existing
strategies fall short: horizontal scaling provisions entire replicas of the
current configuration, often tens to hundreds of accelerators, leading to
coarse granularity, long provisioning delays, and costly overprovisioning.
Vertical scaling offers finer adjustments but typically requires instance
restarts, incurring downtime. These limitations make current approaches
ill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud
deployments.
  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that
achieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE
decouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to
proceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses
weights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth
peer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without
interrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism
migrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory
usage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.
  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that
ElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput
during scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to
baselines. By enabling fine-grained, concurrent scaling with minimal
disruption, ElasticMoE advances the practicality of deploying massive MoE LLMs
in dynamic cloud environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据量和维度的增加，RNN-Descent算法在图构建阶段的复杂度急剧上升，导致构建时间过长，影响后续查询处理效率。

Method: 引入无序邻居传播策略避免同步更新陷阱，利用warp级协作操作和双缓冲邻居池进行高效内存访问，实现高度并行化的邻居更新。

Result: GRNND在实验中持续优于现有CPU和GPU方法，相比GPU方法获得2.4到51.7倍加速，相比CPU方法获得17.8到49.8倍加速。

Conclusion: GRNND成功解决了RNN-Descent在大规模高维数据下的性能瓶颈，为信息检索等相关任务提供了高效的近似最近邻图构建方案。

Abstract: Relative Nearest Neighbor Descent (RNN-Descent) is a state-of-the-art
algorithm for constructing sparse approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) graphs by
combining the iterative refinement of NN-Descent with the edge-pruning rules of
the Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG). It has demonstrated strong effectiveness
in large-scale search tasks such as information retrieval and related tasks.
However, as the amount and dimensionality of data increase, the complexity of
graph construction in RNN-Descent rises sharply, making this stage increasingly
time-consuming and even prohibitive for subsequent query processing. In this
paper, we propose GRNND, the first GPU-parallel algorithm of RNN-Descent
designed to fully exploit GPU architecture. GRNND introduces a disordered
neighbor propagation strategy to mitigate synchronized update traps, enhancing
structural diversity, and avoiding premature convergence during parallel
execution. It also leverages warp-level cooperative operations and a
double-buffered neighbor pool with fixed capacity for efficient memory access,
eliminate contention, and enable highly parallelized neighbor updates.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRNND consistently outperforms existing
CPU- and GPU-based methods. GRNND achieves 2.4 to 51.7x speedup over existing
GPU methods, and 17.8 to 49.8x speedup over CPU methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型服务系统采用静态、手动、管道级的资源分配方式，无法适应不同阶段和请求的资源需求差异，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出动态阶段级服务范式，自动推导模型部署位置和请求路由策略，协同优化模型和请求的资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，TridentServe在各种工作负载下比现有方法提升SLO达成率，平均/P95延迟分别降低2.5倍和3.6倍/4.1倍。

Conclusion: 动态阶段级服务范式能有效解决扩散模型服务中的资源分配不匹配问题，显著提升服务性能。

Abstract: Diffusion pipelines, renowned for their powerful visual generation
capabilities, have seen widespread adoption in generative vision tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image/video). These pipelines typically follow an
encode--diffuse--decode three-stage architecture. Current serving systems
deploy diffusion pipelines within a static, manual, and pipeline-level
paradigm, allocating the same resources to every request and stage. However,
through an in-depth analysis, we find that such a paradigm is inefficient due
to the discrepancy in resource needs across the three stages of each request,
as well as across different requests. Following the analysis, we propose the
dynamic stage-level serving paradigm and develop TridentServe, a brand new
diffusion serving system. TridentServe automatically, dynamically derives the
placement plan (i.e., how each stage resides) for pipeline deployment and the
dispatch plan (i.e., how the requests are routed) for request processing,
co-optimizing the resource allocation for both model and requests. Extensive

Abstract: We investigate the energy efficiency of a library designed for parallel
computations with sparse matrices. The library leverages high-performance,
energy-efficient Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators to enable
large-scale scientific applications. Our primary development objective was to
maximize parallel performance and scalability in solving sparse linear systems
whose dimensions far exceed the memory capacity of a single node. To this end,
we devised methods that expose a high degree of parallelism while optimizing
algorithmic implementations for efficient multi-GPU usage. Previous work has
already demonstrated the library's performance efficiency on large-scale
systems comprising thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, achieving improvements over
state-of-the-art solutions. In this paper, we extend those results by providing
energy profiles that address the growing sustainability requirements of modern
HPC platforms. We present our methodology and tools for accurate runtime energy
measurements of the library's core components and discuss the findings. Our
results confirm that optimizing GPU computations and minimizing data movement
across memory and computing nodes reduces both time-to-solution and energy
consumption. Moreover, we show that the library delivers substantial advantages
over comparable software frameworks on standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了云处理地球观测大数据(EOBD)中的能效问题，识别了现有平台的能效差距，并提出了改进的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地球观测数据量快速增长和云计算广泛应用，能效问题日益突出。现有EOBD处理平台主要关注数据可访问性和计算可行性，而忽视了能效方面，这与大数据处理中日益关注的能源成本和碳足迹问题形成反差。

Method: 首先分析当前EOBD处理现状和云处理需求，调查现有云基EOBD解决方案，然后研究其他大数据领域成功的能效策略，通过对比分析识别EOBD处理中的能效差距。

Result: 识别出四个关键能效差距：能源监测机制不足、数据管理缺乏能效意识、资源分配未充分实施能效策略、任务调度缺乏能效标准。

Conclusion: 提出了开发能效感知的性能监测和基准测试框架、使用优化技术进行基础设施编排、以及采用能效任务调度方法等解决方案，旨在提高EOBD处理的能效意识，减少能耗和环境影响，同时保持处理性能。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data volumes are rapidly increasing. While cloud
computing are now used for processing large EO datasets, the energy efficiency
aspects of such a processing have received much less attention. This issue is
notable given the increasing awareness of energy costs and carbon footprint in
big data processing, particularly with increased attention on compute-intensive
foundation models. In this paper we identify gaps in energy efficiency
practices within cloud-based EO big data (EOBD) processing and propose several
research directions for improvement. We first examine the current EOBD
landscape, focus on the requirements that necessitate cloud-based processing
and analyze existing cloud-based EOBD solutions. We then investigate energy
efficiency strategies that have been successfully employed in well-studied big
data domains. Through this analysis, we identify several critical gaps in
existing EOBD processing platforms, which primarily focus on data accessibility
and computational feasibility, instead of energy efficiency. These gaps include
insufficient energy monitoring mechanisms, lack of energy awareness in data
management, inadequate implementation of energy-aware resource allocation and
lack of energy efficiency criteria on task scheduling. Based on these findings,
we propose the development of energy-aware performance monitoring and
benchmarking frameworks, the use of optimization techniques for infrastructure
orchestration, and of energy-efficient task scheduling approaches for
distributed cloud-based EOBD processing frameworks. These proposed approaches
aim to foster more energy awareness in EOBD processing , potentially reducing
power consumption and environmental impact while maintaining or minimally
impacting processing performance.

Abstract: The intelligent Distributed Dispatch and Scheduling (iDDS) service is a
versatile workflow orchestration system designed for large-scale, distributed
scientific computing. iDDS extends traditional workload and data management by
integrating data-aware execution, conditional logic, and programmable
workflows, enabling automation of complex and dynamic processing pipelines.
Originally developed for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider,
iDDS has evolved into an experiment-agnostic platform that supports both
template-driven workflows and a Function-as-a-Task model for Python-based
orchestration.
  This paper presents the architecture and core components of iDDS,
highlighting its scalability, modular message-driven design, and integration
with systems such as PanDA and Rucio. We demonstrate its versatility through
real-world use cases: fine-grained tape resource optimization for ATLAS,
orchestration of large Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) workflows for the Rubin
Observatory, distributed hyperparameter optimization for machine learning
applications, active learning for physics analyses, and AI-assisted detector
design at the Electron-Ion Collider.
  By unifying workload scheduling, data movement, and adaptive decision-making,
iDDS reduces operational overhead and enables reproducible, high-throughput
workflows across heterogeneous infrastructures. We conclude with current
challenges and future directions, including interactive, cloud-native, and
serverless workflow support.
