Differential fuzzing, in\nparticular, operates as a guided randomized search, aiming to find (similar)\ninputs that lead to a maximum difference in software outputs or their\nbehaviors. However, fuzzing, as a dynamic analysis, lacks any guarantees on the\nabsence of bugs: from a differential fuzzing campaign that has observed no bugs\n(or a minimal difference), what is the risk of observing a bug (or a larger\ndifference) if we run the fuzzer for one or more steps?\n  This paper investigates the application of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to\naddress the risk of missing or underestimating bugs in differential fuzzing.\nThe key observation is that differential fuzzing as a random process resembles\nthe maximum distribution of observed differences. Hence, EVT, a branch of\nstatistics dealing with extreme values, is an ideal framework to analyze the\ntail of the differential fuzzing campaign to contain the risk. We perform\nexperiments on a set of real-world Java libraries and use differential fuzzing\nto find information leaks via side channels in these libraries. We first\nexplore the feasibility of EVT for this task and the optimal hyperparameters\nfor EVT distributions. We then compare EVT-based extrapolation against baseline\nstatistical methods like Markov's as well as Chebyshev's inequalities, and the\nBayes factor. EVT-based extrapolations outperform the baseline techniques in\n14.3% of cases and tie with the baseline in 64.2% of cases. Finally, we\nevaluate the accuracy and performance gains of EVT-enabled differential fuzzing\nin real-world Java libraries, where we reported an average saving of tens of\nmillions of bytecode executions by an early stop."}

Creating rigorous ACs is particularly challenging in the\ncontext of software product lines (SPLs), i.e, sets of software products with\noverlapping but distinct features and behaviours. Since SPLs can encompass very\nlarge numbers of products, developing a rigorous AC for each product\nindividually is infeasible. Moreover, if the SPL evolves, e.g., by the\nmodification or introduction of features, it can be infeasible to assess the\nimpact of this change. Instead, the development and maintenance of ACs ought to\nbe lifted such that a single AC can be developed for the entire SPL\nsimultaneously, and be analyzed for regression in a variability-aware fashion.\nIn this article, we describe a formal approach to lifted AC development and\nregression analysis. We formalize a language of variability-aware ACs for SPLs\nand study the lifting of template-based AC development. We also define a\nregression analysis to determine the effects of SPL evolutions on\nvariability-aware ACs. We describe a model-based assurance management tool\nwhich implements these techniques, and illustrate our contributions by\ndeveloping an AC for a product line of medical devices."}

Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional\nLLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code\nquality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for\nspecific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving\ncontexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and\nexecuting workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based\nagents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce\nRefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software\nrefactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and\nthe search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a\nmedian F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively.
