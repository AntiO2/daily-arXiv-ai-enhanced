However, when we apply these methods to artificial intelligence initiatives -- especially those involving large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems -- the results can be systematically misleading. This paper shares an evidence-backed analysis of five foundational assumptions we often make during T-shirt sizing. While these assumptions usually hold true for traditional software, they tend to fail in AI contexts: (1) linear effort scaling, (2) repeatability from prior experience, (3) effort-duration fungibility, (4) task decomposability, and (5) deterministic completion criteria. Drawing on recent research into multi-agent system failures, scaling principles, and the inherent unreliability of multi-turn conversations, we show how AI development breaks these rules. We see this through non-linear performance jumps, complex interaction surfaces, and \"tight coupling\" where a small change in data cascades through the entire stack. To help teams navigate this, we propose Checkpoint Sizing: a more human-centric, iterative approach that uses explicit decision gates where scope and feasibility are reassessed based on what we learn during development, rather than what we assumed at the start. This paper is intended for engineering managers, technical leads, and product owners responsible for planning and delivering AI initiatives."}

LLMs often produce confident descriptions of what the code looks like it should do (intent), while missing subtle edge cases or logic changes that define what it actually does (behavior). We present a mutation-based evaluation methodology that directly tests whether a summary truly matches the code's logic. Our approach generates a summary, injects a targeted mutation into the code, and checks if the LLM updates its summary to reflect the new behavior. We validate it through three experiments totalling 624 mutation-summary evaluations across 62 programs. First, on 12 controlled synthetic programs with 324 mutations varying in type (statement, value, decision) and location (beginning, middle, end). We find that summary accuracy decreases sharply with complexity from 76.5% for single functions to 17.3% for multi-threaded systems, while mutation type and location exhibit weaker effects. Second, testing 150 mutated samples on 50 human-written programs from the Less Basic Python Problems (LBPP) dataset confirms the same failure patterns persist as models often describe algorithmic intent rather than actual mutated behavior with a summary accuracy rate of 49.3%. Furthermore, while a comparison between GPT-4 and GPT-5.2 shows a substantial performance leap (from 49.3% to 85.3%) and an improved ability to identify mutations as \"bugs\", both models continue to struggle with distinguishing implementation details from standard algorithmic patterns. This work establishes mutation analysis as a systematic approach for assessing whether LLM-generated summaries reflect program behavior rather than superficial textual patterns."}

There are many tools to detect errors automatically, but fixing those issues is still mostly a manual, slow, and costly process in which it is easy for developers to overlook specific details. The situation becomes even more complex with modern Single-Page Applications (SPAs), whose dynamic nature makes traditional static analysis approaches inadequate. This work proposes a system that aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate accessibility fixes. The proposal presents a modular workflow applicable to both static websites and complex Angular projects. The framework actively implements corrections within the DOM of static web pages or the source code of SPAs. The system was tested on 12 static websites and 6 open-source Angular projects, fixing 80% of the accessibility issues on public websites and 86% of the issues on Angular applications. Our proposal also generates meaningful visual descriptions for images while preserving the application's design and stability. This work contributes to ensuring that accessibility stops being a technical debt deferred to the future and becomes a natural part of everyday development workflows."}

Although AI has enhanced the productivity of development tasks, it remains unstudied whether AI essentially outperforms humans in type-related programming tasks, such as employing type constructs properly for type safety, during its tasks. Moreover, there is no systematic study that evaluates whether AI agents overuse or misuse the type constructs under the complicated type systems to the same extent as humans. In this study, we present the first empirical analysis to answer these questions in the domain of TypeScript projects. Our findings show that, in contrast to humans, AI agents are 9x more prone to use the 'any' keyword. In addition, we observed that AI agents use advanced type constructs, including those that ignore type checks, more often compared to humans. Surprisingly, even with all these issues, Agentic pull requests (PRs) have 1.8x higher acceptance rates compared to humans for TypeScript. We encourage software developers to carefully confirm the type safety of their codebases whenever they coordinate with AI agents in the development process."}

Implementation and evaluation study of cross-boundary agent orchestration for Gemini Enterprise UI", "summary": "Enterprise conversational UIs increasingly need to orchestrate heterogeneous backend agents and tools across project and account boundaries in a secure and reproducible way. Starting from Gemini Enterprise Agent-to-Agent (A2A) invocation, we implement an A2A Hub orchestrator on Cloud Run that routes queries to four paths: a public A2A agent deployed in a different project, an IAM-protected Cloud Run A2A agent in a different account, a retrieval-augmented generation path combining Discovery Engine and Vertex AI Search with direct retrieval of source text from Google Cloud Storage, and a general question answering path via Vertex AI. We show that practical interoperability is governed not only by protocol compliance but also by Gemini Enterprise UI constraints and boundary-dependent authentication. Real UI requests arrive as text-only inputs and include empty accepted output mode lists, so mixing structured data into JSON-RPC responses can trigger UI errors. To address this, we enforce a text-only compatibility mode on the JSON-RPC endpoint while separating structured outputs and debugging signals into a REST tool API. On a four-query benchmark spanning expense policy, project management assistance, general knowledge, and incident response deadline extraction, we confirm deterministic routing and stable UI responses. For the retrieval path, granting storage object read permissions enables evidence-backed extraction of the fifteen minute deadline. All experiments are reproducible using the repository snapshot tagged a2a-hub-gemini-ui-stable-paper."}

Unlike prior work that optimizes efficiency or query filtering, fairness imposes count constraints to ensure proportional representation across groups defined by protected attributes. When fairness spans multiple attributes, these constraints must be satisfied simultaneously, making the problem computationally hard. To address this, we propose a computational framework that produces high-quality approximate nearest neighbors with good trade-offs between search time, memory/indexing cost, and recall. We adapt locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to accelerate candidate generation and build a lightweight index over the Cartesian product of protected attribute values. Our framework retrieves candidates satisfying joint count constraints and then applies a post-processing stage to construct fair $k$-NN results across all attributes. For 2 attributes, we present an exact polynomial-time flow-based algorithm; for 3 or more, we formulate ILP-based exact solutions with higher computational cost. We provide theoretical guarantees, identify efficiency--fairness trade-offs, and empirically show that existing vector search methods cannot be directly adapted for fairness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the generality of the proposed framework and scalability."}

As a result, the energy and carbon characteristics of small language models (SLMs) during test generation remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work introduces the DeCEAT framework, which systematically evaluates the environmental and performance trade-offs of SLMs using the HumanEval benchmark and adaptive prompt variants (based on the Anthropic template). The framework quantifies emission and time-aware behavior under controlled conditions, with CodeCarbon measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions, and unit test coverage assessing the quality of generated tests. Our results show that different SLMs exhibit distinct sustainability strengths: some prioritize lower energy use and faster execution, while others maintain higher stability or accuracy under carbon constraints. These findings demonstrate that sustainability in the generation of SLM-driven tests is multidimensional and strongly shaped by prompt design. This work provides a focused sustainability evaluation framework specifically tailored to automated SLM-based test generation, clarifying how prompt structure and model choice jointly influence environmental and performance outcomes."}

This creates a fundamental write-before-query barrier: compression decisions are made before the system knows what a future query will hinge on. As a result, summaries can cause unverifiable omissions -- decisive constraints (e.g., allergies) may be dropped, leaving the agent unable to justify an answer with traceable evidence. Retaining raw logs restores an authoritative source of truth, but grounding on raw logs by default is expensive: many queries are answerable from summaries, yet raw grounding still requires processing far longer contexts, inflating token consumption and latency.\n  We propose TierMem, a provenance-linked framework that casts retrieval as an inference-time evidence allocation problem. TierMem uses a two-tier memory hierarchy to answer with the cheapest sufficient evidence: it queries a fast summary index by default, and a runtime sufficiency router Escalates to an immutable raw-log store only when summary evidence is insufficient. TierMem then writes back verified findings as new summary units linked to their raw sources.

One of these aspects is how individuals perceive themselves regarding their work, i.e., their work identity, and the processes they perform to form, adapt and reject these identities, i.e., identity work. Existent studies provide evidence of such identity work of software professionals triggered by the adoption of GenAI, however they do not consider differences among diverse roles, such as developers and testers. In this paper, we argue the need for considering the role as a factor defining the identity work of software professionals. To support our claim, we review some studies regarding different roles and also recent studies on how to adopt GenAI in software engineering. Then, we propose a research agenda to better understand how the role influences identity work of software professionals triggered by the adoption of GenAI, and, based on that, to propose new artifacts to support this adoption.

However, the limited on-chip memory of these accelerators forces inference runtimes to swap model segments between host and accelerator memory, substantially inflating latency. While collaborative processing by partitioning the model processing between CPU and accelerator resources can reduce accelerator memory pressure and latency, naive partitioning may worsen end-to-end latency by either shifting excessive computation to the CPU or failing to sufficiently curb swapping, a problem that is further amplified in multi-tenant and dynamic environments.\n  To address these issues, we present SwapLess, a system for adaptive, multi-tenant TPU-CPU collaborative inference for memory-constrained Edge TPUs. SwapLess utilizes an analytic queueing model that captures partition-dependent CPU/TPU service times as well as inter- and intra-model swapping overheads across different workload mixes and request rates. Using this model, SwapLess continuously adjusts both the partition point and CPU core allocation online to minimize end-to-end response time with low decision overhead. An implementation on Edge TPU-equipped platforms demonstrates that SwapLess reduces mean latency by up to 63.8% for single-tenant workloads and up to 77.4% for multi-tenant workloads relative to the default Edge TPU compiler."}

Despite growing interest, the interview competence of LLMs in conversational requirements elicitation remains fully underexplored. Existing evaluations often depend on a few scenarios, real user interaction, and subjective human scoring, which hinders systematic and quantitative comparison. To address these challenges, we propose ReqElicitGym, an interactive and automatic evaluation environment for assessing interview competence in conversational requirements elicitation. Specifically, ReqElicitGym introduces a new evaluation dataset and designs both an interactive oracle user and a task evaluator. The dataset contains 101 website requirements elicitation scenarios spanning 10 application types. Both the oracle user and the task evaluator achieve high agreement with real users and expert judgment. Using our ReqElicitGym, any automated conversational requirements elicitation approach (e.g., LLM-based agents) can be evaluated in a reproducible and quantitative manner through interaction with the environment. Based on our ReqElicitGym, we conduct a systematic empirical study on seven representative LLMs, and the results show that current LLMs still exhibit limited interview competence in uncovering implicit requirements. Particularly, they elicit less than half of the users' implicit requirements, and their effective elicitation questions often emerge in later turns of the dialogue. Besides, we found LLMs can elicit interaction and content implicit requirements, but consistently struggle with style-related requirements. We believe ReqElicitGym will facilitate the evaluation and development of automated conversational requirements elicitation."}

We establish that, if the monoid is weakly cancellative then the standard axioms of inclusion dependencies are sound and complete for the implication problem.

Existing GPU memory estimators span three paradigms -- analytical models, CPU-side libraries, and ML-based estimators -- each with distinct limitations: dependence on detailed model specifications, intrusive integration, poor generalization, and varying latency overhead. GPU heterogeneity further complicates estimation, as identical tasks can exhibit markedly different memory footprints across hardware generations. GPU utilization remains comparatively understudied, further complicated by the non-additive nature of utilization metrics and hardware sensitivity. We conduct a systematic analysis of representative estimators from each paradigm -- Horus, PyTorch FakeTensor, and our lightweight ML-based estimator -- evaluating accuracy, generalizability, and practical overhead. We construct a synthetic dataset spanning MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers with controlled architectural variations, and train MLP- and Transformer-based estimators for memory prediction. We further experiment with utilization estimation on the same dataset. Our evaluation reveals key tradeoffs and validates estimators against real-world unseen models.

The approach consists of four steps: defining quantitative specification limits, performing stratified and probabilistic sampling, applying bootstrapping to estimate a confidence interval for the performance metric, and calculating a capability index as a final indicator. The approach was evaluated through a case study on two real-world AI systems in industry involving interviews with AI experts. Valuable insights were collected from the experts regarding the utility, ease of use, and intention to adopt the methodology in practical scenarios. We conclude that the proposed approach is a feasible and valuable way to operationalize the assessment of functional correctness, moving the evaluation from a point estimate to a statement of statistical confidence."}

This is largely due to the theoretical challenges and practical applications of these problems. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of distributed sub-hypergraph enumeration in hypergraphs. To this end, we (1)~introduce several computational models for hypergraphs that generalize the CONGEST model for graphs and evaluate their relative computational power, (2)~devise algorithms for distributed triangle enumeration in our computational models and prove their optimality in two such models, (3)~introduce classes of sparse and ``everywhere sparse'' hypergraphs and describe efficient distributed algorithms for triangle enumeration in these classes, and (4)~describe general techniques that we believe to be useful for designing efficient algorithms in our hypergraph models."}

We build a Docker measurement pipeline and apply it to a stratified sample of 2,000 GitHub repositories that contained a Dockerfile. We found that only 56% produce any buildable image, and just 2.7% of those are bitwise reproducible without any infrastructure configurations. After modifying infrastructure configurations, we raise bitwise reproducibility by 18.6%, but 78.7% of buildable Dockerfiles remain non-reproducible. We analyze the root causes of the remaining differences, and find that beyond timestamps and metadata, developer-controlled choices such as uncleaned caches, logs, documentation, and floating versions are dominant causes of non-reproducibility. We derive concrete Dockerfile guidelines from these patterns and discuss how they can inform future linters and Continuous Integration (CI) checks for reproducible containers."}

This paper presents a technical solution for heterogeneous mixed training in AMD-NVIDIA environments. We first adopt a compatibility-oriented approach based on CPU-Forwarding Communication, with differentiated communication back-end selection across parallel groups and multi-NIC parallel data transfer. To achieve higher performance, we further propose another Device-Direct Communication approach, integrating a CPU-offloading P2P mechanism to enable direct cross-vendor GPU data transfer without host-memory staging. Experiments on LLaMA-8B and Qwen2-7B demonstrate that the proposed Device-Direct Communication approach achieves up to 98% of the throughput of an NVIDIA homogeneous system, while preserving training stability and correctness."}

It is not the final published version (Version of Record) and does not reflect any post-acceptance improvements. The Version of Record is available online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2026.108414", "summary": "A growing number of critical workflow applications leverage a streamlined edge-hub-cloud architecture, which diverges from the conventional edge computing paradigm. An edge device, in collaboration with a hub device and a cloud server, often suffices for their reliable and efficient execution. However, task allocation in this streamlined architecture is challenging due to device limitations and diverse operating conditions. Given the inherent criticality of such workflow applications, where reliability and latency are vital yet conflicting objectives, an exact task allocation approach is typically required to ensure optimal solutions. As no existing method holistically addresses these issues, we propose an exact multi-objective task allocation framework to jointly optimize the overall reliability and latency of a workflow application in the specific edge-hub-cloud architecture. We present a comprehensive binary integer linear programming formulation that considers the relative importance of each objective. It incorporates time redundancy techniques, while accounting for crucial constraints often overlooked in related studies. We evaluate our approach using a relevant real-world workflow application, as well as synthetic workflows varying in structure, size, and criticality. In the real-world application, our method achieved average improvements of 84.19% in reliability and 49.81% in latency over baseline strategies, across relevant objective trade-offs. Overall, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach across diverse workflow applications for the considered system architecture, highlighting its practicality with runtimes averaging between 0.03 and 50.94 seconds across all examined workflows."}

First introduced in the seminal paper by Naor and Stockmeyer [STOC 1993], these are graph problems that can be described by listing a finite set of valid local neighborhoods. This seemingly simple definition strikes a careful balance between two objectives: they are a family of problems that is broad enough so that it captures numerous problems that are of interest to researchers working in this field, yet restrictive enough so that it is possible to prove strong theorems that hold for all LCL problems. In particular, the distributed complexity landscape of LCL problems is now very well understood.\n  In this work we show that the family of LCL problems is extremely robust to variations. We present a very restricted family of locally checkable problems (essentially, the \"node-edge checkable\" formalism familiar from round elimination, restricted to regular unlabeled graphs); most importantly, such problems cannot directly refer to e.g. the existence of short cycles. We show that one can translate between the two formalisms (there are local reductions in both directions that only need access to a symmetry-breaking oracle, and hence the overhead is at most an additive $O(\\log^* n)$ rounds in the LOCAL model)."}

In the context of cloud-native applications deployed across the cloud-edge continuum, this challenge translates into identifying energy-efficient deployment strategies that consider not only the computational demands of application components but also the environmental impact of the nodes on which they are executed. Generating deployment plans that account for these dynamic factors is non-trivial, due to fluctuations in application behaviour and variations in the carbon intensity of infrastructure nodes. In this paper, we present an approach for the automatic generation of deployment plans guided by green constraints. These constraints are derived from a continuous analysis of energy consumption patterns, inter-component communication, and the environmental characteristics of the underlying infrastructure. This paper introduces a methodology and architecture for the generation of a set of green-aware constraints that inform the scheduler to produce environmentally friendly deployment plans. We demonstrate how these constraints can be automatically learned and updated over time using monitoring data, enabling adaptive, energy-aware orchestration. The proposed approach is validated through realistic deployment scenarios of a cloud-native application, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing energy usage and associated emissions."}
